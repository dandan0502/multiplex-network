This unlinks and unparents the pad, and when gst_pad_buffer_alloc_unchecked() returns back to gst_pad_alloc_buffer_full() it detects that there's been a caps change because the caps have been cleared as a consequence of what the release request pad function did, so it tries to do gst_pad_configure_src() which fails with a g_warning() in gst_pad_get_caps_unlocked() because the pad no longer has any parent (obviously).++Created attachment 116611  [details]  [review] tee_release_request_pad_while_buffer_alloc_testcaseThe attached patch adds a test-case to tests/check/tee.c that reproduces the race reliably by staging a disaster by orchestrating the interaction between the pretend streaming thread and pretend application thread.

407941,orca,general,[verified] Infer labels for objects in HTML content,"There are web accessibility guidelines for setting the relationship between labels and the things they are labelling in things such as HTML forms.  We're discovering that web content developers do not follow these guidelines.  For example, see the username/password areas on http://www.charter.net and https://www.google.com/accounts/Login .  As a result of this, it's highly desirable for Orca to attempt to infer the label for things that seem like they should have a label, but the labelled_by property is not set.++I messed around with this today, and I think it is going to require some refactoring of how we get the displayed label for an object.  Currently, scripts call util.getDisplayedLabel directly, and this depends upon application developers setting up accessible relations correctly.For Gecko, I think we want to do something a little different.  I tried looking at things such as the accessible hierarchy of the pages in question to determine if the ancestral relationship yielded any common design pattern.  They are unfortunately different.  As a result, I think we may need to look at geographic proximity of objects if util.getDisplayedLabel fails to find anything.To do so, we could determine the set of objects on the same line as the object in question using getLineContentsAtOffset.  We could then look at the objects immediately prior to or following the object in question and determine if they are possible labels.  To accomplish this, I think we need to do the refactoring described in bug 395548 .  In particular, create default.py:getDisplayedLabel, which delegates to util.py.  Change all scripts and {speech,braille}generators to call script.getDisplayedLabel instead of util.getDisplayedLabel.I started mucking with this, and the impact is rather large and risky for GNOME 2.18 (it touches 7 modules in not-so-subtle ways).  In addition, I think I may have uncovered YAFFB where getting the same child via the same index from the same object in Firefox doesn't yield the same object for us to do equality comparisons on.  The impact of that problem is that it hinders our ability to solve this bug.++The search area on the left hand side of http://sfbay.craigslist.org/ is another example of an unlabelled text entry.  It has the label above the text area.++At the Mozilla meetings at CSUN, we discussed the idea that Gecko should support the heuristics for this and that it should offer up a label-guess attribute of some form.  Maybe the value could be a nested numeric path similar to what at-poke shows us (e.g., 0.5.4.2 means ""starting at the html document frame, get child 0 and then child 5 of that child and child 4 of that child..."").++See also Mozilla bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=376481++If we are going to have to do some inference based on spatial relationships, it would be helpful to know the direction of the text in question.  I haven't figured out where this gets exposed by Firefox.  I believe other apps expose it as one of their text attributes.  I'm also not convinced that Firefox is failing to expose it *somehow*:  If you look at a page with a mixture of Arabic and English in Accerciser, Accerciser displays the Arabic text on the right-hand side and the caretOffset reflects a rtl order as you arrow within it.  Any ideas how Accerciser knows? :-)  Thanks!++Tom Brunet'scomment on the mozilla bug/RFE: <start>Here's a general idea of what Home Page Reader used as a heuristic.  First, from the  documentation that comes with the product:HPR renders a label for each control by looking for one of the following pieces of information: 1. Surrounding LABEL element. LABEL element with for attribute value matching control element ID. 2. Text immediately following or preceding the control element in the same, previous, or next item. 3. Text in the previous, next, or above table cell. 4. title attribute.---That's a little vague for this purpose, so here's a little more detail.For text inputs:1. Text/img that precedes control in same item.2. Text/img that follows control in same item (nothing between end of text and item)3. Text/img that precedes control in previous item/cell (not another control in that item)4. Text/img in cell above without other controls in cell above    Throw out #4 if other controls in this cell aboveFor checkboxes/radio buttons:1. Text/img that follows control in same item.2. Text/img that precedes control in same item (nothing between start of text and item)3. Text/img that follows control in next item/cell (not another control in that item)4. Text/img that precedes control in previous item/cell (not another control in that item)5. Text/img in cell above without other controls in cell above    Throw out #5 if other controls in this cell above---An item boundary usually created a visual line break, but I don't think I can easily expand more on that.  Also, you might want to consider labels for radio groups?This heuristic wasn't perfect, but worked quite well for us - at least for most situations that didn't completely ignore UI guidelines.  Eyeballing it, you might run into trouble if a survey-like set of radio buttons had labels below each radio button.I hope this helps a little.<end>Thoughts?++I figured I'd start with entries.  Given that we cannot count on the position in the hierarchy and instead have to look at things spatially, my plan was to use getLineContentsAtOffset() to get all the objects on the line.  Then I would figure out which object was the entry.  Once I knew where the entry was with respect to the line, I could use getExtents() to figure out where things were spatially in relation to the entry and then do the guessing based on that.  The trick seems to be figuring out where the entry is with respect to the line.Test case:  In simpleform.html from orca/test/html, I typed ""hello world"" in the entry that immediately follows ""Type something in here:"".  Then I did the following three times in a row:1. Clicked on ""Type something in here""2. Pressed TabBelow are the results.  It seems that in any given cycle we have three accessibles representing the entry:1. An accessible representing the object as our locusOfFocus (i.e. the object for which we're trying to guess a label)2. An accessible from the perspective of getLineContentsAtOffset()3. An accessible from the perspective of the paragraph that contains the entry----------------locusOfFocus:  <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a03ec>                entry, text: hello worldline:  [[<orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630e4c>, 0, 28],         [<orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a064c>, 0, 11]]Item 1: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630e4c>        paragraph, text:  Type something here:        ￼        child: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630f4c>               entry, text:  hello worldItem 2: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a064c>        entry, text:  hello worldlocusOfFocus:  <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630eac>               entry, text: hello worldline:  [[<orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630aec>, 0, 28],         [<orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630d8c>, 0, 11]]Item 1: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630aec>        paragraph, text:  Type something here:        ￼        child: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a012c>               entry, text:  hello worldItem 2: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630d8c>        entry, text:  hello worldlocusOfFocus:  <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a03cc>               entry, text: hello worldline:  [[<orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a03ec>, 0, 28],         [<orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a016c>, 0, 11]]Item 1: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a03ec>        paragraph, text:  Type something here:        ￼        child: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630a8c>                entry text:  hello worldItem 2: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a016c>        entry, text:  hello world----------------Am I missing something?  I would have thought that we'd find the accessible that represents the entry in what is returned by getLineContentsAtOffset() -- either directly or as the child of the paragraph that contains the entry.... Insight and/or suggestions on how to proceed and/or snarky comments welcome. :-)  In the meantime, I'm going to walk away from this for a bit in the hopes that a new, more reliable plan reveals itself.  Thanks!++It appears that, despite a bit of multiple personality disorder, the entries are sufficiently in touch with reality to know that they occupy the same physical space.

And you had a comment in that method indicating it needed doing, so I did it.  :-) The good news is that it seems to work reasonably well.  The exception is that Gecko.getSpeechContext() now chats up a storm.  :-(  My best guess is that we were avoiding some chattiness not by explicit design but rather as a side effect of not handling text that contained EOCs in getDisplayedText().  But I could easily be missing something.  If so, please let me know what that something is. :-)In the meantime, in order to facilitate your testing the label guessing functionality, I solved this problem temporarily by having getSpeechContext() always return an empty list until we can discuss what really should be done.  As an aside, having getSpeechContext() return an empty list doesn't seem to have any noticeable impact on what Orca says or doesn't say.Anyhoo, this patch was tested successfully with the following:1. The test case I just attached2. Gmail - compose new message (basic HTML version)3. Google's advanced search page (with one exception)4. Bugzilla's enter a new bug formKnown issues:1. On Google's advanced search page, we're not picking up the ""label"" on the very first entry; the rest of the entries seem fine.  I suspect when I look at this after a break, the reason why will be obvious to me.2. On bugzilla, with existing bugs, tabbing to the Additional Comments entry causes a traceback.  We're getting a negative Y extent, plus there are several hidden objects and a bunch of EOCs that aren't even showing up in Accerciser.... I'm not convinced the solution here will be as obvious, but I'll look at it as well after a break.Please let me know what you think.  Thanks!++TODO:  It looks like the guesswork I did to identify a grid of fields  should not just take into account the field immediately above the current field, but instead consider all of the fields up to the top of the column.  For example, see the ""re-enter email address"" entry on the monster.com create account page ( http://my.monster.com/Account/Account.aspx ).  We're speaking  ""Use 4 to 20 letters and/or numbers"" because the entry immediately above us is the same size.++> I still want to know why they are claiming to be three different accessibles,> however.  Will, any guesses? This is usually the result of one of the following:1) Something somewhere on the AT side did not ref() the CORBA accessible.  When this happens, the thing on the other side (e.g., Gecko) can feel free to garbage collect and then give us different objects for the same object over different calls.  This doesn't seem to be the case.2) The thing on the other side has a bug where it doesn't keep track of the object it gave us, and thus chooses to just keep giving us a different object for the same child. You might be able to verify this by repeatedly calling getChildAtIndex on the thing holding the text entry to see if it keeps giving us a different child.++> Will:  As I had emailed you yesterday, it seems like being able to use> getDisplayedText()  with text that is made up of EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTERs> would be handy.

If so, please> let me know what that something is. :-) The main problem is that the speech context code does not expect a parent to defer to its children for more text.  The presence of EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTERs (EOCs) stuff throws a monkey wrench into this.  A thing to think about is whether we want to just toss out speech context in specific situations (e.g.,places where we are obviously not in a typical WIMP hierarchy). > Anyhoo, this patch was tested successfully with the following: Cool!++Created attachment 87768  [details] slightly revised test case++Created attachment 87769  [details]  [review] cleaner, better, and now with combo box support! :-)This version is actually worth testing I think.  There are still known issues, plenty of work to do, etc., but the functionality of our heuristic approach to label guessing is starting to shape up -- at least with respect to entries and combo boxes. :-)Improvements over the last version:* All of the entry known issues I mentioned before seem to be resolved* Added a check for text below the line (but that is not in a table cell)* Added basic support for guessing combo box labels* Separated things out into smaller methods so that guessTheLabel() is no longer a single, monstrous blob of code. :-) * No longer completely nuking the functionality of getSpeechContext() -- only nuking it if in the document frame. :-) (Will gave me lots of good things to think about -- I need to think about them.)New Known Issues:* If you use form field structural navigation to move to a multi-line entry, we're not guessing the labels.  This is due to one of my go{Next, Previous}FormField() hacks.  Once Aaron's relevant patches are in the build, that should be a non-issue.  Hopefully that will be fixable tomorrow.  In the meantime, to test guessing functionality w.r.t. multi-line entries, use Tab/Shift+Tab to move focus there.* Every once in a while there is a combo box that we're not guessing the label for; instead we're guessing an item inside the combo box, but not the currently selected one.  Examples:  On the Google advanced search page, the ""10 results"" combo box; in bugzilla, the ""resolution"" combo box.  I suspect this is a no-brainer, but it's after 2AM and *I'm* now a no-brainer. :-) I'll hopefully fix this issue tomorrow as well.Question for Mike:If you look at the attachment table in bugzilla, there is a combo box for the status of each attachment.  Currently, we're grabbing just the cell on its immediate left and not the whole line.  What should we be saying there?  Keep in mind that this is all heuristics, so it's not just ""it should read the whole line"" but ""it should read the whole line because the text is all squished together"" (in which case, we need to define what constitutes ""squished"" <grin>). Nap time. :-)++(In reply to comment #15 ) > Created an attachment (id=87769) [edit]> cleaner, better, and now with combo box support! :-) Way cool.  Definitely looks cleaner and better.  Mike, please test this!++This seems to work well on many combo boxes however the first problem I've noticed is the following: 1.  open this bug to comment on it.  2. Tab or insert+tab to the first two combo boxes after the save button. You'll notice that the first two combo boxes after the safe button have the size of the patch for there label.  I'll keep testing of course but this is just my first finding.++Thanks for testing Mike.  There are definitely kinks that need to be worked out so please keep reporting them as you find them. > You'll notice that the first two combo boxes after the safe button have the> size of the patch for there label.

Currently, we're grabbing just the cell on its> immediate left and not the whole line.  What should we be saying there?++Mike:  In addition to the above combo box situation, I need guidance on what you would like me to do about checkboxes and radio buttons.  We, of course, want to guess their labels.  But beyond that, what context if any should we attempt to provide as part of the guess?  For instance, if the user presses Tab or Orca_Modifier+Tab and lands on a checkbox called ""Red"", we'll say ""Red"" as the label.  But if there's a group of checkboxes (like the addition of a ""Green"" checkbox and ""Blue"" checkbox), there's probably some contextual text somewhere like ""What is your favorite color?"" or ""What color should your towel NOT be if you want to avoid being impaled by a bull?""  Do we going looking for that text as well as part of the label?  If so, where do we go looking for it? These sorts of things are not addressed in the approach described by Tom Brunet; what he describes is strictly for identifying the ""Red"" bit.  Thanks!++I really don't think we will be able to do anything extra here with out getting a whole lot of false possitives.  I think at this point you should just stick with the plan of speaking the lavel for each button or check box.  If you come up with any really clever way in the future of infering group information we can revisit this at that time.   After our phone call earlier I also don't think you should try to get any more information for the combo boxes I talked about in comment 17 .  I think your current solution will get the labels for the vast majority of comboboxes that users will encounter without extra verbosity.++> I really don't think we will be able to do anything extra here with out getting> a whole lot of false possitives. I tend to agree.  The solution here is working around a problem that should be addressed at the content provider level.  I hate giving them a free ride when there are specifications in place that say how to create accessible content.  I do realize there will always be lunkhead content generators that create inaccessible content, though, so some level of guessing is good.  One question on the table is if what Joanie currently has done is at a sufficient level. Mike, Joanie, if you think it is, is this bug ready for closure?++I still have to do lists, radio buttons, and checkboxes as well as the little check you and I talked about to see if we're in an entry or password_text in getUtterancesFromContents().

Bypassing things with EOC's is still probably a fair thing to do -- one problem with including them is that you may end up digging back into the object you came from, so you'll duplicate text.

I'm just marking this as 'reviewed' mostly because I want to wait to see what Mike's testing shows.  If his testing is positive, assume I said ""accepted commit now!""  :-)++This is really looking good.  I'm no longer getting the false possitives I was.  I'm for checking it in and letting the community work with it.++oops, the patch is trying to guess labels when we are moving by words within an entry. :-(If you are writing a comment and move around with Left, Right, Up, or Down, we're good; try Control Left or Right and we guess the label....There's your answer to what's up with word navigation Mike.  Let me see what I can figure out....++Created attachment 89219  [details]  [review] modify sayWord() to handle entries itselfAs part of the new label guess functionality, getUtterancesFromContents() relies more on the speechgenerators rather than on getText().  sayWord() was calling getUtterancesFromContents() so we were doing all sorts of things that we shouldn't be doing during a sayWord() such as guessing the label, speaking the line at the caret, etc. I tried having sayWord() call default.sayWord() when in an entry as we are doing with sayLine(). Worked going forward; not backward.  Now sayWord() handles entries itself.  So much for having a hack-free patch. ;-)Mike, please test.  (label guess logic, speech, and braille should be unchanged; navigation by word is all that is different)  Thanks!++I've just re-tested this patch and all now seems well with navigating by control+left and right.  Label guess still also seems to be working fine.++Thanks Mike.  Will, do you have any issues with my revised sayWord()?  Ways I could have done it better, etc.?++> Will, do you have any issues with my revised sayWord()?  Ways I could have done> it better, etc.?

From the development side, all I can say is that I'm fixin' to get me a bottle of champagne. ;-)Although I must say that Rich's addition of GUI support for app-specific and app-unique settings is just as nice.Anyhoo, since Mike has verified this one, I'm closing it as FIXED."

Doesn't work with libsoup yet because soup doesn't support file: URIs. I think danw is considering adding local file or gvfs support, but there's a bit of debate about where in the platform this feature should go. It is easy enough to implement (maybe a couple hundred lines) so we can take care of it in WebKit if danw's not hot on the idea. cc'ing him.(I stopped working on this git branch after rhult said he might want to keep the abstraction layer, but I can complete it if there's interest.

This unlinks and unparents the pad, and when gst_pad_buffer_alloc_unchecked() returns back to gst_pad_alloc_buffer_full() it detects that there's been a caps change because the caps have been cleared as a consequence of what the release request pad function did, so it tries to do gst_pad_configure_src() which fails with a g_warning() in gst_pad_get_caps_unlocked() because the pad no longer has any parent (obviously).++Created attachment 116611  [details]  [review] tee_release_request_pad_while_buffer_alloc_testcaseThe attached patch adds a test-case to tests/check/tee.c that reproduces the race reliably by staging a disaster by orchestrating the interaction between the pretend streaming thread and pretend application thread.

407941,orca,general,[verified] Infer labels for objects in HTML content,"There are web accessibility guidelines for setting the relationship between labels and the things they are labelling in things such as HTML forms.  We're discovering that web content developers do not follow these guidelines.  For example, see the username/password areas on http://www.charter.net and https://www.google.com/accounts/Login .  As a result of this, it's highly desirable for Orca to attempt to infer the label for things that seem like they should have a label, but the labelled_by property is not set.++I messed around with this today, and I think it is going to require some refactoring of how we get the displayed label for an object.  Currently, scripts call util.getDisplayedLabel directly, and this depends upon application developers setting up accessible relations correctly.For Gecko, I think we want to do something a little different.  I tried looking at things such as the accessible hierarchy of the pages in question to determine if the ancestral relationship yielded any common design pattern.  They are unfortunately different.  As a result, I think we may need to look at geographic proximity of objects if util.getDisplayedLabel fails to find anything.To do so, we could determine the set of objects on the same line as the object in question using getLineContentsAtOffset.  We could then look at the objects immediately prior to or following the object in question and determine if they are possible labels.  To accomplish this, I think we need to do the refactoring described in bug 395548 .  In particular, create default.py:getDisplayedLabel, which delegates to util.py.  Change all scripts and {speech,braille}generators to call script.getDisplayedLabel instead of util.getDisplayedLabel.I started mucking with this, and the impact is rather large and risky for GNOME 2.18 (it touches 7 modules in not-so-subtle ways).  In addition, I think I may have uncovered YAFFB where getting the same child via the same index from the same object in Firefox doesn't yield the same object for us to do equality comparisons on.  The impact of that problem is that it hinders our ability to solve this bug.++The search area on the left hand side of http://sfbay.craigslist.org/ is another example of an unlabelled text entry.  It has the label above the text area.++At the Mozilla meetings at CSUN, we discussed the idea that Gecko should support the heuristics for this and that it should offer up a label-guess attribute of some form.  Maybe the value could be a nested numeric path similar to what at-poke shows us (e.g., 0.5.4.2 means ""starting at the html document frame, get child 0 and then child 5 of that child and child 4 of that child..."").++See also Mozilla bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=376481++If we are going to have to do some inference based on spatial relationships, it would be helpful to know the direction of the text in question.  I haven't figured out where this gets exposed by Firefox.  I believe other apps expose it as one of their text attributes.  I'm also not convinced that Firefox is failing to expose it *somehow*:  If you look at a page with a mixture of Arabic and English in Accerciser, Accerciser displays the Arabic text on the right-hand side and the caretOffset reflects a rtl order as you arrow within it.  Any ideas how Accerciser knows? :-)  Thanks!++Tom Brunet'scomment on the mozilla bug/RFE: <start>Here's a general idea of what Home Page Reader used as a heuristic.  First, from the  documentation that comes with the product:HPR renders a label for each control by looking for one of the following pieces of information: 1. Surrounding LABEL element. LABEL element with for attribute value matching control element ID. 2. Text immediately following or preceding the control element in the same, previous, or next item. 3. Text in the previous, next, or above table cell. 4. title attribute.---That's a little vague for this purpose, so here's a little more detail.For text inputs:1. Text/img that precedes control in same item.2. Text/img that follows control in same item (nothing between end of text and item)3. Text/img that precedes control in previous item/cell (not another control in that item)4. Text/img in cell above without other controls in cell above    Throw out #4 if other controls in this cell aboveFor checkboxes/radio buttons:1. Text/img that follows control in same item.2. Text/img that precedes control in same item (nothing between start of text and item)3. Text/img that follows control in next item/cell (not another control in that item)4. Text/img that precedes control in previous item/cell (not another control in that item)5. Text/img in cell above without other controls in cell above    Throw out #5 if other controls in this cell above---An item boundary usually created a visual line break, but I don't think I can easily expand more on that.  Also, you might want to consider labels for radio groups?This heuristic wasn't perfect, but worked quite well for us - at least for most situations that didn't completely ignore UI guidelines.  Eyeballing it, you might run into trouble if a survey-like set of radio buttons had labels below each radio button.I hope this helps a little.<end>Thoughts?++I figured I'd start with entries.  Given that we cannot count on the position in the hierarchy and instead have to look at things spatially, my plan was to use getLineContentsAtOffset() to get all the objects on the line.  Then I would figure out which object was the entry.  Once I knew where the entry was with respect to the line, I could use getExtents() to figure out where things were spatially in relation to the entry and then do the guessing based on that.  The trick seems to be figuring out where the entry is with respect to the line.Test case:  In simpleform.html from orca/test/html, I typed ""hello world"" in the entry that immediately follows ""Type something in here:"".  Then I did the following three times in a row:1. Clicked on ""Type something in here""2. Pressed TabBelow are the results.  It seems that in any given cycle we have three accessibles representing the entry:1. An accessible representing the object as our locusOfFocus (i.e. the object for which we're trying to guess a label)2. An accessible from the perspective of getLineContentsAtOffset()3. An accessible from the perspective of the paragraph that contains the entry----------------locusOfFocus:  <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a03ec>                entry, text: hello worldline:  [[<orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630e4c>, 0, 28],         [<orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a064c>, 0, 11]]Item 1: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630e4c>        paragraph, text:  Type something here:        ￼        child: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630f4c>               entry, text:  hello worldItem 2: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a064c>        entry, text:  hello worldlocusOfFocus:  <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630eac>               entry, text: hello worldline:  [[<orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630aec>, 0, 28],         [<orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630d8c>, 0, 11]]Item 1: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630aec>        paragraph, text:  Type something here:        ￼        child: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a012c>               entry, text:  hello worldItem 2: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630d8c>        entry, text:  hello worldlocusOfFocus:  <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a03cc>               entry, text: hello worldline:  [[<orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a03ec>, 0, 28],         [<orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a016c>, 0, 11]]Item 1: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a03ec>        paragraph, text:  Type something here:        ￼        child: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x8630a8c>                entry text:  hello worldItem 2: <orca.atspi.Accessible instance at 0x87a016c>        entry, text:  hello world----------------Am I missing something?  I would have thought that we'd find the accessible that represents the entry in what is returned by getLineContentsAtOffset() -- either directly or as the child of the paragraph that contains the entry.... Insight and/or suggestions on how to proceed and/or snarky comments welcome. :-)  In the meantime, I'm going to walk away from this for a bit in the hopes that a new, more reliable plan reveals itself.  Thanks!++It appears that, despite a bit of multiple personality disorder, the entries are sufficiently in touch with reality to know that they occupy the same physical space. Therefore I can use extents to compare objects.I still want to know why they are claiming to be three different accessibles, however.

And you had a comment in that method indicating it needed doing, so I did it.  :-) The good news is that it seems to work reasonably well.  The exception is that Gecko.getSpeechContext() now chats up a storm.  :-(  My best guess is that we were avoiding some chattiness not by explicit design but rather as a side effect of not handling text that contained EOCs in getDisplayedText().  But I could easily be missing something.  If so, please let me know what that something is. :-)In the meantime, in order to facilitate your testing the label guessing functionality, I solved this problem temporarily by having getSpeechContext() always return an empty list until we can discuss what really should be done.  As an aside, having getSpeechContext() return an empty list doesn't seem to have any noticeable impact on what Orca says or doesn't say.Anyhoo, this patch was tested successfully with the following:1. The test case I just attached2. Gmail - compose new message (basic HTML version)3. Google's advanced search page (with one exception)4. Bugzilla's enter a new bug formKnown issues:1. On Google's advanced search page, we're not picking up the ""label"" on the very first entry; the rest of the entries seem fine.  I suspect when I look at this after a break, the reason why will be obvious to me.2. On bugzilla, with existing bugs, tabbing to the Additional Comments entry causes a traceback.  We're getting a negative Y extent, plus there are several hidden objects and a bunch of EOCs that aren't even showing up in Accerciser.... I'm not convinced the solution here will be as obvious, but I'll look at it as well after a break.Please let me know what you think.  Thanks!++TODO:  It looks like the guesswork I did to identify a grid of fields  should not just take into account the field immediately above the current field, but instead consider all of the fields up to the top of the column.  For example, see the ""re-enter email address"" entry on the monster.com create account page ( http://my.monster.com/Account/Account.aspx ).  We're speaking  ""Use 4 to 20 letters and/or numbers"" because the entry immediately above us is the same size.++> I still want to know why they are claiming to be three different accessibles,> however.  Will, any guesses? This is usually the result of one of the following:1) Something somewhere on the AT side did not ref() the CORBA accessible.  When this happens, the thing on the other side (e.g., Gecko) can feel free to garbage collect and then give us different objects for the same object over different calls.  This doesn't seem to be the case.2) The thing on the other side has a bug where it doesn't keep track of the object it gave us, and thus chooses to just keep giving us a different object for the same child. You might be able to verify this by repeatedly calling getChildAtIndex on the thing holding the text entry to see if it keeps giving us a different child.++> Will:  As I had emailed you yesterday, it seems like being able to use> getDisplayedText()  with text that is made up of EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTERs> would be handy.

The presence of EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTERs (EOCs) stuff throws a monkey wrench into this.  A thing to think about is whether we want to just toss out speech context in specific situations (e.g.,places where we are obviously not in a typical WIMP hierarchy). > Anyhoo, this patch was tested successfully with the following: Cool!++Created attachment 87768  [details] slightly revised test case++Created attachment 87769  [details]  [review] cleaner, better, and now with combo box support! :-)This version is actually worth testing I think.  There are still known issues, plenty of work to do, etc., but the functionality of our heuristic approach to label guessing is starting to shape up -- at least with respect to entries and combo boxes. :-)Improvements over the last version:* All of the entry known issues I mentioned before seem to be resolved* Added a check for text below the line (but that is not in a table cell)* Added basic support for guessing combo box labels* Separated things out into smaller methods so that guessTheLabel() is no longer a single, monstrous blob of code. :-) * No longer completely nuking the functionality of getSpeechContext() -- only nuking it if in the document frame. :-) (Will gave me lots of good things to think about -- I need to think about them.)New Known Issues:* If you use form field structural navigation to move to a multi-line entry, we're not guessing the labels.  This is due to one of my go{Next, Previous}FormField() hacks.  Once Aaron's relevant patches are in the build, that should be a non-issue.  Hopefully that will be fixable tomorrow.  In the meantime, to test guessing functionality w.r.t. multi-line entries, use Tab/Shift+Tab to move focus there.* Every once in a while there is a combo box that we're not guessing the label for; instead we're guessing an item inside the combo box, but not the currently selected one.  Examples:  On the Google advanced search page, the ""10 results"" combo box; in bugzilla, the ""resolution"" combo box.  I suspect this is a no-brainer, but it's after 2AM and *I'm* now a no-brainer. :-) I'll hopefully fix this issue tomorrow as well.Question for Mike:If you look at the attachment table in bugzilla, there is a combo box for the status of each attachment.  Currently, we're grabbing just the cell on its immediate left and not the whole line.  What should we be saying there?  Keep in mind that this is all heuristics, so it's not just ""it should read the whole line"" but ""it should read the whole line because the text is all squished together"" (in which case, we need to define what constitutes ""squished"" <grin>). Nap time. :-)++(In reply to comment #15 ) > Created an attachment (id=87769) [edit]> cleaner, better, and now with combo box support! :-) Way cool.  Definitely looks cleaner and better.  Mike, please test this!++This seems to work well on many combo boxes however the first problem I've noticed is the following: 1.  open this bug to comment on it.  2. Tab or insert+tab to the first two combo boxes after the save button. You'll notice that the first two combo boxes after the safe button have the size of the patch for there label.  I'll keep testing of course but this is just my first finding.++Thanks for testing Mike.  There are definitely kinks that need to be worked out so please keep reporting them as you find them. > You'll notice that the first two combo boxes after the safe button have the> size of the patch for there label. Yup, this is what I was referring to in comment #15 when I said: > Question for Mike:> If you look at the attachment table in bugzilla, there is a combo box for the> status of each attachment.  Currently, we're grabbing just the cell on its> immediate left and not the whole line.  What should we be saying there?++Mike:  In addition to the above combo box situation, I need guidance on what you would like me to do about checkboxes and radio buttons.  We, of course, want to guess their labels.  But beyond that, what context if any should we attempt to provide as part of the guess?  For instance, if the user presses Tab or Orca_Modifier+Tab and lands on a checkbox called ""Red"", we'll say ""Red"" as the label.  But if there's a group of checkboxes (like the addition of a ""Green"" checkbox and ""Blue"" checkbox), there's probably some contextual text somewhere like ""What is your favorite color?"" or ""What color should your towel NOT be if you want to avoid being impaled by a bull?""  Do we going looking for that text as well as part of the label?  If so, where do we go looking for it? These sorts of things are not addressed in the approach described by Tom Brunet; what he describes is strictly for identifying the ""Red"" bit.  Thanks!++I really don't think we will be able to do anything extra here with out getting a whole lot of false possitives.  I think at this point you should just stick with the plan of speaking the lavel for each button or check box.  If you come up with any really clever way in the future of infering group information we can revisit this at that time.   After our phone call earlier I also don't think you should try to get any more information for the combo boxes I talked about in comment 17 .  I think your current solution will get the labels for the vast majority of comboboxes that users will encounter without extra verbosity.++> I really don't think we will be able to do anything extra here with out getting> a whole lot of false possitives. I tend to agree.  The solution here is working around a problem that should be addressed at the content provider level.  I hate giving them a free ride when there are specifications in place that say how to create accessible content.  I do realize there will always be lunkhead content generators that create inaccessible content, though, so some level of guessing is good.  One question on the table is if what Joanie currently has done is at a sufficient level. Mike, Joanie, if you think it is, is this bug ready for closure?++I still have to do lists, radio buttons, and checkboxes as well as the little check you and I talked about to see if we're in an entry or password_text in getUtterancesFromContents().  Shouldn't take very long to do these things, but they're not done yet.  I'll look at them a bit later today.  I think we can move the target for this to 2.19.3.++Created attachment 89166  [details]  [review] latest version: adds lists, radio buttons, checkboxes, plus other cases/conditionsThis adds lists, radio buttons, and checkboxes into the mix; cleans up some bugs; addresses more cases for entries and combo boxes; and probably does some other stuff that I will remember after the nap I'm about to take.  :-)This is not the final version; what remains is dealing with getSpeechContext() which I am (still) currently bypassing for document content in order to isolate the guessing logic and properly expand EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTERS.  Will, I think I'm going to need your help with that -- at least to brainstorm about what exactly we want to do.In the meantime, Mike please test this patch for its guessing accuracy.Thanks guys!!++(In reply to comment #23 ) > Created an attachment (id=89166) [edit]> latest version: adds lists, radio buttons, checkboxes, plus other> cases/conditions Wow!

Will, I> think I'm going to need your help with that -- at least to brainstorm about> what exactly we want to do. You bet.  Bypassing things with EOC's is still probably a fair thing to do -- one problem with including them is that you may end up digging back into the object you came from, so you'll duplicate text.  Another problem is that you might end up bubbling up to something like the document frame and you could end up speaking the entire document (I think).  Give me a ping on IRC/AOL or call me, though, and we can brainstorm.++Created attachment 89190  [details]  [review] very minor change; some typo corrections++I'm currently on the phone with Joanie and I've pointed out some small edit field problems with the following pages.  live.gnome.org and a personalized www.google.com page.  Braille is also quite messed up and Joanie is aware of this.++Something dawned on me around the same time it seemed to be witnessed by Mike with whom I just spoke:  Expanding EOC's in getDisplayedText()  f's mightily with braille. :-(So the question is, do we adjust all of our calls in Gecko.py -- I think we can do so by passing in the endOffset of the current EOC to getDisplayedText(). -- or do we not expand the text there and instead do something clever somewhere else?++Created attachment 89199  [details]  [review] Be more conservative when guessingIf it's not in the form, don't guess it as a label.The flip side of being conservative in this way is that there will be occasions in which the ""label"" is contained in some object (section, paragraph, perhaps a table cell) and that object in turn contains the form.  Handling that scenario *accurately* will need some thought.  In the meantime Mike, please give this a spin -- from a speech perspective. :-)  Thanks!!++Mike, don't bother testing the most recent patch.  I chatted with Will and a new solution that should make everything (including braille) good will be forthcoming.  Stay tuned!++Created attachment 89210  [details]  [review] latest version:  Don't mess with getDisplayedText()I am now leaving getDisplayedText() alone and expanding EOCs in Gecko.py.   getSpeechContext() is back to doing its thing, braille is (theoretically) untouched by this patch.Mike please test.  Thanks!++> Created an attachment (id=89210) [edit]> latest version:  Don't mess with getDisplayedText() Cool.  Looking good!  I'm just marking this as 'reviewed' mostly because I want to wait to see what Mike's testing shows.  If his testing is positive, assume I said ""accepted commit now!""  :-)++This is really looking good.  I'm no longer getting the false possitives I was.  I'm for checking it in and letting the community work with it.++oops, the patch is trying to guess labels when we are moving by words within an entry. :-(If you are writing a comment and move around with Left, Right, Up, or Down, we're good; try Control Left or Right and we guess the label....There's your answer to what's up with word navigation Mike.  Let me see what I can figure out....++Created attachment 89219  [details]  [review] modify sayWord() to handle entries itselfAs part of the new label guess functionality, getUtterancesFromContents() relies more on the speechgenerators rather than on getText().  sayWord() was calling getUtterancesFromContents() so we were doing all sorts of things that we shouldn't be doing during a sayWord() such as guessing the label, speaking the line at the caret, etc. I tried having sayWord() call default.sayWord() when in an entry as we are doing with sayLine(). Worked going forward; not backward.  Now sayWord() handles entries itself.  So much for having a hack-free patch. ;-)Mike, please test.  (label guess logic, speech, and braille should be unchanged; navigation by word is all that is different)  Thanks!++I've just re-tested this patch and all now seems well with navigating by control+left and right.  Label guess still also seems to be working fine.++Thanks Mike.  Will, do you have any issues with my revised sayWord()?

Also changing theaccount to use POP did not help.Additional Information:Machine Configuration------------------------------------------------------------------Red Hat Linux release 9 (Shrike) i386 2.4.20-20.8evolution1.5-1.5.3.0.200401270733-0.snap.ximian.6.1evolution-data-server-0.0.6.0.200401270733-0.snap.ximian.6.1soup-0.7.10-4libsoup-1.99.28.0.200310211728-0.snap.ximian.6.1libsoup2.2-2.1.5.0.200401270733-0.snap.ximian.6.1libgtkhtml3.1_3-3.1.7.0.200401270733-0.snap.ximian.6.1libgal21-0.23-1libgal2.0_3-1.99.8-0.ximian.6.3libgal2.2_0-2.1.4.0.200401270733-0.snap.ximian.6.1gtkhtml-1.1.8-5gtkhtml3.0-3.0.9-0.ximian.6.1gtkhtml3.1-3.1.7.0.200401270733-0.snap.ximian.6.1gal-0.23-1pilot-link-0.11.5-4gnome-pilot-0.1.71-2gnome-mime-data-2.2.0-1gtk+-1.2.10-25gtk2-2.2.1-4bonobo-1.0.22-4libbonoboui-2.4.3-0.ximian.6.1libbonobo-2.4.2-0.ximian.6.2libgnomecanvas-2.2.0.2-0.ximian.6.2ORBit2-2.9.5-0.ximian.6.1++when I click on Send/Receive the following is printed in the terminalwhere evolution was started.-----------------------------------------------------------------received: * OK Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 IMAP4rev1 server version6.5.6944.0 (ex2k3.xcs.ximian.com) ready.sending : A00000 CAPABILITYreceived: * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 IDLE LOGIN-REFERRALSMAILBOX-REFERRALS NAMESPACE LITERAL+ UIDPLUS CHILDREN AUTH=NTLMreceived: A00000 OK CAPABILITY completed.sending : A00001 LOGOUTreceived: * BYE Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 IMAP4rev1 serverversion 6.5.6944.0 signing off.++gconftool-2 -g /apps/evolution/mail/accounts[<?xml version=""1.0""?><account name="" gangell@xcs.ximian.com "" uid=""1075236705.18028.0@tlee""enabled=""true""><identity><name>GeorgeAngell</name><addr-spec> gangell@xcs.ximian.com </addr-spec><reply-to>GeorgeAngell &lt; gangell@xcs.ximian.com &gt;</reply-to><organization>QualityAssurance</organization><signature auto=""false""default=""-1""/></identity><source save-passwd=""false""keep-on-server=""false"" auto-check=""false""auto-check-timeout=""0""><url>imap:// gangell@ex2k3.boston.ximian.com </url></source><transportsave-passwd=""false""><url>smtp:// gangell@ex2k3.boston.ximian.com </url></transport><drafts-folder>email://local@local/Drafts</drafts-folder><sent-folder>email://local@local/Sent</sent-folder><auto-ccalways=""false""><recipients></recipients></auto-cc><auto-bccalways=""false""><recipients></recipients></auto-bcc><pgpencrypt-to-self=""false"" always-trust=""false"" always-sign=""false""no-imip-sign=""false""><key-id></key-id></pgp><smimesign-default=""false"" encrypt-default=""false""encrypt-to-self=""false""><sign-key-id></sign-key-id><encrypt-key-id></encrypt-key-id></smime></account>]++i presume restarting it works?its probably some bad interaction with offline mode andem-folder-tree-m odel.++so i worked out the order of events: - when account gets added, thread invoked to add the store - meanwhile, the code goes forth, and adds the store from the accounturi, the store is offline though - the thread returns and the store is in 'connecting' state, tries toadd it to em-folder-tree-model which just spits a warning and ignores it - i dont think it matters about the order much, whatever happensit'll get added in offline mode i think, before it goes online.so the folders never get added.  this is basically what stops 'goingonline' from working right too.so jeff, just make em_folder_tree_model_add_store clear/reset thestore's folder tree, i guess++ok, this is now done in CVS"

It should be using a smaller fontthere, but it looks like it chose the wrong font for some reason.++As a result of the UI freeze today, I'm marking all remaining non-1.0 UI bugs to'future'. Someone reading this should only change the target back to 1.0 underthe following circumstances:1) The change would not impact documentation. (i.e., 'how to do X' would nothave to be changed in any way.)2) The change would require trivial work for the programmers involved. Mostlikely, only the programmers themselves are able to judge this. So, if you arenot on the evo team, or cannot provide a patch to them for this, you shouldprobably not make any such changes. Sorry that this is going to impact so many irritating bugs, but we have toprioritize our limited resources.++Changing to 1.0. Should try to fix.++Fixed in CVS, I think.

245531,evolution,Mailer,Draft mail not saved after crash recovery,"Description of Problem: Evolution froze (see bug 245528 ) while I was writinga mail, so I had to kill and restart it. It recovered the message I waswriting but then I saved it as draft and closed it. It doesn't complain inany way but when 2 minutes later I wanted to continue that mail, the mailwasn't in my draft directory. Note, that this bug doesn't seem to be related to 45528 even though Idiscovered this one because of 45528. This bug is still present if you justkill evolution (even if it didn't freeze).Steps to reproduce the problem:1. Write part of a mail2. Wait long enough for the ""autosave"" to be called3. Kill and restart evolution4. Say yes to recover mail and save it as draft5. Close it6. Go to your draft folder and see the mail isn't there.Actual Results: No mail (at least not the right one) in the draft folderExpected Results: Mail saved in the draft folderHow often does this happen?

Well, to be 100% sure, Ichecked all my draft folders and checked the ""Drafts"" settings for mydefault account (which I used to write the test email).

82190,gnome-media,Gnome-CD,Gnome CD should not have it's own themes,"Since gnome-cd is part of the core gnome desktop it should be completelythemable through gtk for accessibility reasons. Bill at sun has been prettystrict on his interpretation of the law stating that all theming must bebased on a central system theme. note: Yes i do not think nautilus should have it's own themes either.++I don't personally really think that this is worth blocking any GNOMErelease over, but Bill and wipro should be aware of this issue; upping.In the general case, I'm sure it would help a lot more if the stockGNOME icons had generic media player icons; I'm cc'ing the art dudesbecause that is something they may want to think about going forward.++The icons used by default are from Tigert's icons page, but when theAPI for GTK froze, so did the icons that could go in, so these iconsare from the official collection :)++louie: agreed this is minor in the sense that gnome-cd theme problemsaren't a big enough issue to block a gnome2 release, especiallyconsidering that the nautilus icon view might as well be consindereinaccessible since it's not themed at all by gtk i believe (except forfonts).Also i was refering more to the display color background, which is areally cool red right now. but is set by the gnome-cd theme. It wouldbe cool if the effect was achieved using the gtk theme color and maybea transparent pixmap to create the lined effect. Someone on gnome newsmentioned this last week, and this actually motivated me to file this bug.++Hmm, interesting idea++I dunno, this is more ""wishlist"". Anyone got any complaints?++Ian, i would have no problem punting this for sometime post 2.0.However i do think it should be done eventually..++I think we need to decide what to do ASAP even if the fix is put infor 2.0.X instead of 2.0.0.Basically any app that uses pixmaps/PNGs/images in a theme-like wayneeds to either be rewritten to reflect GTK+ themes (i.e. use themeengines to do the drawing) or be based on icons pixmaps whichthemselves can be themed.  This is especially true in the case wherethe graphics are mostly eye candy.  An alternative for apps whose maintainers simply cannot live withoutthe nifty cool custom graphics and who won't either convert them touse themeable ""icons"" or gtkstyle drawing commands would be to allow a""uses GTK+ theme"" option which would then probably become the defaulton destops where accessibility was an expected option (i.e. multiuserlogins, kiosks, educational settings, etc.).The reason we haven't given a ""formula"" for what we'd like you to do(Iain) is that we don't want to tell you how to code your app, justwhat we need the end result to do :-)-Bill++Can I just clarify that if this accessibility theme looks ugly, thenI'm not going to set it as the default.

I believe these are the icons that are meant to be added to gtkeventually, and they are much nicer looking. Only other comment i have is that maybe the resolution of the pixmapsused to draw the borders could be increased. Since the cornersespecially look somewhat jagged.Other than that great job.++Created attachment 9160  [details] Updated accessibility theme with the icons taken from media theme++Hi Bordoley, Thanks for the inputs. I have updated the accessibilitytheme with the icons from ""media theme"". The above patch is in tarformat. I was not able to change the resolution of the pixmaps. Any specialoption for this in Gimp that I am missing ?++Rajkumar:Maybe tigert or jimmac can give you advice with the pixmaps. I don'treally know much about gimp, but the corners look sort of jagged.Maybe adding some nice anti-aliasing to the corners would look nice (iknow either tigert or jimmac had a tutorial on this available..eg. howto create an antialias effect using the gimp)also thought about this last nite, why doesn't gnome-cd register it'sbuttons with the stock icon system. If i'm not mistaken, wouldn't thisallow the gnome-cd buttons to be themed using the standard gtkrctheming mechanism. I know galeon registers quite a few icons with thestock system that aren't part of the gtk defaults. (maybe i'm notunderstanding this completely though)++Yeah, I was thinking about doing that. I was also thinking aboutregistering the pixmaps that make up the display so it can all bechanged from a gtkrc. My only concern then is how does one change thetheme except by editting the gtkrc file?++Ian: Regarding the buttons, i think doin them via the stock system isprobably the right thing to do. gtk will add the media icons to it'sstock icons eventually, so forcing users to edit gtkrc files to editthe icons really isn't that big of a deal (and we won't get upsetusers who's old theme icons no longer work, assuming others creategnome-cd themes, when switching to using the gtk-stock icons)Regarding the pixmap background, I don't think it's that big of adeal. I like how the current mechanism works (assuming the use systemtheme option is the default). With my aqua pixmap theme, the displaylooks quite nice, granted, that with the default gtk theme, it doesn'tlook quite as great. However,if we make theme switching easy in theui, i think this is ok. I think using the stock system here is alittle overkill probably++I agree that the pixmaps should be part of the stock icon set.  Thoughit's not ideal perhaps to have this level of interdependence betweenapps and themes, I think it's the best we can do with the currenticon-theming API.  Right now the way we do icon theming is:  add the icon to the stockset, then each RC-file theme specifies replacement pixmap files forthe stock icons, including these ""app-stock"" icons. I don't see a good alternative that works with RC-file theming, atleast at this time.++Bill:Are you saying that the background pixmaps should be themed usinggtkrc. To me that seems like overkill. Imho as long as the buttonicons are themed using gtkrc, and we have a sane use default gtk themepreference for the display, i think this is fine. Nothing reallyinherintly wrong with having independent theming of the displaybackground, since users could pass around some cool themes. Buteverything should by default use gtkrc (as the display does when usingthis accessibility theme)++bordoley: I agree with you about the background, I was talking aboutthe icon pixmaps.++Oh, thats all people are worried about...? Oh thats okay, I thoughteveryone wanted the background to be controlled from gtkrc files as well.++Iain:  my only concern vis-a-vis the background is that one be able toeasily turn it off.  Ideally that would itself be themable, or atleast gconf'ed, or else background off by default (the third optionprobably being unattractive to you).  I don't care about being able to""theme"" it in the sense of being able to provide a replacementbackground in the RC file.We may want to consider a gtksettings variable ""UseBitmaps=false"" orsomething like that, to tell apps not to use fancy bitmaps forbackgrounds or painting of other elements; that would make it easy for""Accessibility"" themes to turn off backgrounds and other hard-to-themebitmaps.++bill the theme is stored in gconf.Here's my proposal( basically just a rehash of our conversation so far)1. Buttons use stock icons. Currently gtk doesn't offer any mediaicons, so gnome-cd should register these icons. preferably using anicon name that can be used universally in gnome, so other media appslike rythmbox will all use the same stock icon. eg.gnome-media-forward etc. (In fact this raises a larger questionperhaps gnome it self should have a superset of stock icons that arenot part of gtk, does it already?)2. The default theme in gnome-cd should be the one Rajkumar did(basically a set transparent pixmaps that is used to draw thebackground border) so that the background of the display is set usingthe gtk theme. (I would like to see this fixed up a bit so that thecorners don't look so jagged, actually i think some of the other iconscould use some tigert and jimmac love too. The media icons are awesomethough).3. Gnome-cd can include other themes for the background, but the usermust explicity set these using the theme chooser in gnome-cd preferences++I think libgnomeui or gtk needs to include those media icons sincethey are used in a variety of apps already. think gnome-record,gnome-cd, rhythmbox ...Including them for each app isn't really an elagant solution..++Jorn: How about if we (the developers who are using these icons) sharethe same names for the stock icons, then soeone only has to change itonce in the gtkrc file? They're not going to get included into themain gtk/libgnomeui until the next API additions are allowed (2.2 Ithink), so this is probably the best solution till then.++yeah, that would be a good temporary solution. How about:gnome-media-next >|gnome-media-previous |<gnome-media-forward >>gnome-media-rewind <<gnome-media-stop []gnome-media-play >gnome-media-pause ||gnome-media-eject?++Bordoley: I have updated the theme with sharp border lines and smoothcorners.

I've also changed the pixmaps for the buttons-- removing the gradientshading effect, which isn't so good if this is our 'accessibility'theme (although what I've replaced them with doesn't really work forlow-contrast themes, unfortunately, only regular and high contrastthemes-- but that's kind of a separate issue).

Why not call the ""current gtk theme"" just ""default"".2. Since we've seemed to agree that icons should be themed via thestock system instead of the current mechanism, shouldn't the defaulticons be the pretty ones, and the more accessible high contrast onescan be included in an accessible gtk theme? (I'd be really againstmaking the black and white ones the default as they are ugly...)++1.  I don't think Iain is prepared to make this theme the default(although the Sun distro probably will, at least), so calling it""default"" might be somehwat misleading... I dunno.  I've alwaysthought ""default"" was a word we should keep out of users' facesanyway, it's kind of geeky :)2. I agree in principle, but until gtk actually supports that sort ofthing (and resizable icons as part of the theme), we need an interimaccessible solution.  Again, if this isn't going to be the defaulttheme for gnome-cd, then most users probably aren't going to see theseicons anyway, or at least not more than once :)(I'm also happy to have a go at making these button icons less uglywhilst maintaining their 'shows up against any background' property,or for anyone else to do the same-- consider the attached ones to be afirst attempt to make sure we at least had *something* there...)++I'll make it the default theme if it looks good.

All icons (eg the context menu icons and buttons) should be themed using the gtk stock system and should be standardized across gnome apps. Therefore gnome cd themes should not include button icons.2. the lcd background should by default use the gtk theme color or pixmap (see my screenshot with the aqua theme it looks nice).

Actually, the gnomemeeting is thefirst application that I found freeze my gnome. After that, I found several applications freeze my gnome. I haveidentified the problem by a help from gnomelist.The problem is that gnomemeeting can not use esd sound server. Andwhenever I am using esd, gnomemeeting will hang my gnome when it accepts incoming calls.So I just killed esd when I want to use gnomemeeting. Then it will befine. Maybe because my onboard sound card is too poor.Anyway, thank you for your kindly help. And I wish someday,gnomemeeting can use esd or other sound server. And I am doubting whywindows can handle sound card more perfectly than current linux do ,:{++That still seems weird to me. Anyway, I will close the bug.GnomeMeeting should suspend ESD.Notice there is no chance to see ESD supported by gnomemeeting anyday, there is a way to make it work, but the sound quality is so poorin full-duplex with ESD that we prefer deactivating it completely."

Don't be afraid toremind me about this patch in about a week.Thanks++General comment - I would also patch GTK to add gtk_window_set_urgent() to encourage the use of this feature.Implementation comments: - indentation and brace alignment need to match the    rest of the file (see GNU coding guidelines, with    some GTK extensions/changes) - when adding a timeout, you have to be sure it gets    removed when the object in user data is destroyed;    you can do this by saving the timeout ID    returned by g_timeout_add() and removing it    with g_source_remove()++Oh, also: - I think changing the color is right, rather than set_state() - to change the color, you could just use modify_bg() probably++Just using modify_bg is useful for the plain engines, but I noticed itdoes not always work for all engines. (The engines that use two colorsfor a background to do a gradient). Is there a way to modify a stylefor an engine through the API? This shouldn't be engine dependentshould it? :-\Set_state is a much more functional solution since, in my mind, ittells a widget to change its appearance according to the state passedas a parameter. But I am unfamiliar with the internals of it so Idon't know if this breaks anything.Your other comments are noted and I will work on those items.++Maybe Owen has some suggestions on set_state, etc.++Not really sure what to say here: - There is no guarantee that buttons will draw correctly   if you set their state to selected:   A) Calling set_state() on any widget that you haven't       implemented yourself is not legal GTK+ code, and      the state will get overwritten, say, if the       mouse goes over the button and it gets set to prelight.   B) Themes may simply not implement drawing buttons in      the selected state.But, on the other hand, yes, gtk_widget_modify_bg() willtypically not be honored by themes that use pixmaps.The only reliable way to get a differently colored buttonis to create a style for the default theme with gtk_style_new() and use gtk_widget_set_style(). But thenyour button won't be themed.++One nice feature of M$ Windows that could be implemented here is theone illustrated in their TweakUI:------------------------------------------------------[x] Prevent applications from stealing focus    <o> Flash taskbar button until I click on it    < > Flash taskbar button [number] times------------------------------------------------------When new windows are open, M$ Windows first looks if any key has beenpressed within the last second (or so). If so, then it creates the newwindow minimized and makes its taskbar button flash. Otherwise, itopens the window normally. This is great, because protects the multitasking feature of anoperating system. Some badly written apps forget that the user isrunning multiple applications at once. Sometimes these apps hurt theusers privacy by making him/her type things in the wrong window.To name a few apps:- Gaim opens ""disconnected!"" and ""logging in"" and chat windows all thetime- Mozilla pops up ""conection error"" dialogs all the timeAnd so on...Is this possible to be implemented?Fabio Gomes de Souza fabio@gs2.SPAM.com.br ++*** Bug 114039 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 99679 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++Fabio: See bug 118372 and bug 115650 .

This bugseems to have dropped back to just being used for the Urgency hint which isseparate from the other two bugs, even if semantically very similar.This bug appears to be blocking on an extended gtk theme system thatspecifically accounts for slashing so that it can work for all themes (see whatOwen said in comment 12 ).  So, perhaps the best thing as far as dependencies areconcerened would be to file a bug against gtk themes and mark it as blockingthis one.

Click the button again to turn the Urgent hint back off.++Hi Elijah (from comment 52 ), I've committed the patch (with a few small changes):2005-05-31  Ray Strode  < rstrode@redhat.com >        Make windows that demand attention more noticeable by        glowing their tasklist buttons ( bug 120439 ).        * libwnck/tasklist.c (struct _WnckTask): add some new        fields to track glowing start time, screenshot,        (wnck_task_init): initialize new fields        (glow_pixbuf): new function to uniformly luminate a        pixbuf by some factor (with 1.0 meaning don't change)        (wnck_task_button_glow): new function to glow tasklist        button by some factor dependent on how long the button        has been glowing.        (wnck_task_clear_glow_start_timeout_id): function to        clear the glow timeout id when it becomes stale        (wnck_task_queue_glow): new function to start glowing a        tasklist button.        (wnck_task_stop_glow): new function to stop glowing a        tasklist butotn.        (wnck_task_finalize): stop glowing any buttons that        are glowing.        (wnck_tasklist_size_allocate): when a button gets hidden        be sure to invalidate its screenshot.        (wnck_task_popup_menu): when a window in a tasklist group        demands attention then make it's menu item bold.        (wnck_task_update_visible_state),        (wnck_task_create_widgets): when a window demands        attention start glowing its tasklist button.        (wnck_task_expose): rename wnck_task_class_group_expose        to wnck_task_expose, handle taking a screenshot of the        button right after it's drawn.++I just updated to libwnck 2.11.3 where this patch should be included, but thetestprogram attached by Elijah in #54 doesn't work. Clicking the button has noeffect on the way the button is displayed in the window list. Am I missingsometing important?++Did you manually apply the patch in attachment 47053  [details]  [review] ?  It hasn't been committedyet because I'm waiting for Havoc, Mark, or Vincent to comment (in particular,I'm curious about the update_wmhints() function--should it check for changes tothe group leader (since we haven't done so previously)?  Should we check forother things that we're not checking for now?  Does it seem to be a sane way tohandle WMHints stuff?)++Ow, no, i just used the official 2.11.3 package that got released today... But Inoticed now that debian already patched that flashing of new windows in, soactually, nothing has changed (except for those two other fixes).I will be waiting for the URGENT-flashing-one then, but it looks like it will bethere soon (at least, I hope :) )++I'd still like comments from Havoc, Mark, or Vincent on this, but as they'repretty busy right now and this really needs to be fixed, I'll go ahead andcommit; if anything needs to be fixed in this patch it won't be a very bigchange anyway...   :)2005-06-16  Elijah Newren  < newren@gmail.com >	Add support for the Urgent hint; fixes the remainder of #120439.	* libwnck/selector.c (wnck_selector_get_window_name): 	* libwnck/tasklist.c (wnck_task_popup_menu,	  wnck_task_get_demands_attention, wnck_task_update_visibile_state,	  wnck_task_create_widgets):	* libwnck/window.[ch] (wnck_window_demands_attention,	  transient_demands_attention,	  wnck_window_or_transient_demands_attention):	function renames from *_demands_attention() to *_needs_attention()	* libwnck/selector.c (wnck_selector_window_state_changed):	* libwnck/tasklist.c (wnck_task_state_changed):	* libwnck/window.h (enum WnckWindowState):	add WNCK_WINDOW_STATE_URGENT and checks for it	* libwnck/window.c (COMPRESS_STATE macro): add	(window)->priv->is_urgent, (struct _WnckWindowPrivate): add	is_urgent_field and need_update_wmhints field),	(_wnck_window_create): provide default group leader but have	update_wmhints() do the actual setting if there is a different one	specified, (_wnck_window_process_property_notify): add need for	updating from WM_HINTS separate from icon_cache_property updating,	(update_state): looks like there's a bug here so throw in a FIXME	though I don't have time to check into it right now,	(update_wmclass): new function to get updates related to WM_HINTS	atom, (force_update_now): call update_wmhints()	* libwnck/xutils.h (_wnck_get_group_leader): remove this function	as it has been replaced by the more comprehensive update_wmhints()	in window.c++i think there's something here breaking the gconfig make option for the 2.6.12kernel.  i can live with menuconfig myself, but thought i'd note it for the bug.++Please consider making this flashing thing an option that can be turned off.There are many situations when windows flash without an apparent need (forinstance, when the OpenOffice opens a detached toolbar)."

I get a full structdeclaration in the docs for GtkWidgetClass, including the/*< private >*/ and /*< public >*/ comments. The reason for thisis that gtkdoc-mkdb.in does the private-stripping only for thingswhich it considers to be widget classes.Moving this bug to gtk-doc for further investigation.++Here is a patch which fixes this in the following way:gtkdoc-scan is changed to emit the declarations of *Class structs toMODULE-decl.txtgtkdoc-mkdb is changed to apply private-stripping to all structs, onlychanging the default from private (for widget and *Class structs) topublic for all other structs. This seems to be actually closer to whatthe gtk-doc docs say about /*< private >*/ and /*< public >*/.++Created attachment 12551  [details]  [review] patch++The patch actually has a small problem that causes e.g theGTypePlugin struct to come out asstruct GTypeModule {struct GTypeModule{  GObject parent_instance;  guint use_count;  GSList *type_infos;  GSList *interface_infos;  gchar *name;};A simple fix is to strip everything up to the first '{' from the $declaration before doing the private stripping, as follows:	my $decl = $declaration;	$decl =~ s/^[^{]*{//;	foreach $decl_line (split (/\n/, $decl)) {++Committed, incorporating comments from Damon.++I'm not happy with this change .. it changed structures endingin Class from being default public to being default private.E.g., various bits of class structure docs in Pango get lostfrom the template files with the new gtk-doc.Plus, the difference between widget and non-widget structureswasn't supposed to be whether stripping occured or notbut whether the default was public or private, so I thinkthere is some misinterpretation of what was going on here.++Hmm, but with the old code, you would have never gotten anydeclarations for Class structs into the docs (although you may havegotten field docs from the templates).We can certainly change the default for Class structs to public.But you agree that stripping should happen for all structs ? Fact isthat the old code did the stripping only for widget structs.++Clearly there are problems with the old code, but I'm notsure that we've identified them correctly.If you look at the code of ParseStructDeclaration, you'llsee that the intended usage is that it should strip whether or not $is_object is set.The way the code works is that it first strips everythingbetween the struct ... { and the end of the first <public> if $is_object is set.===    # For objects, assume private    if ($is_object) {        $declaration =~ s!(struct\s+\w*\s*\{)                          .*?                          (?:/\*\s*<\s*public\s*>\s*\*/|(?=\}))!$1!msgx;    }===And then for all structures, it strips portions between<private> and <public>===    # Assume end of declaration if line begins with '}'    $declaration =~ s!\n?[ \t]*/\*\s*<\s*(private|protected)\s*>\s*\*/                      .*?                      (?:/\*\s*<\s*public\s*>\s*\*/|(?=^\}))!!msgx;===Apparently that isn't working correctly for some reason forstructures that default to public.++No, that code is working fine, but ParseStructDeclaration onlydetermines the fields for which docs are displayed. The stripping forthe struct declaration itself happens in OutputStruct (look for thecomment# Form a pretty-printed, private-data-removed form of the declaration)and there stripping did only happen for widgets.++Yeah, after reading through the changes in detail, I thinkI understand what is going onI guess your reasoning for making Classes private by defaultwas because they were not emitted at all before. But certainly that isn't correct for the Pango and Bonoboclasses that were previously exempted from ""don't emitclasses""; they definitely shouldn't suddenly becomeprivate by default.I'm less sure about GObject classes; my suspicion isthat they should be public by defauly because the classstructure members form part of the public interface; unlike instance members, you can't hide them behindwrappers.On the other hand, people really should explicitely haveto say that it is OK for the public to override aparticular virtual function; there are some virtual functions in GTK+ that form part of the internals of GTK+. (Thinkof all the virtual functions in GtkCList for an extremeexample.)Virtual functions for the default handlers for signals areinherently public, except for keybinding signals, wherethey are really private. (It's too bad we didn't redoall the keybinding signals like gtkmenushell.c:cycle_focus)Sigh. A mess. The Pango+Bonbo exemption is certainlynot something we should preserve long term.++If it helps, I would volunteer to add /*< public >*/ to the beginningof all Pango class structs...++And Bonobo too? :-)Cc'ing Michael to see if he remembers anything particularabout what structures ending in Class he wanted to documentin Bonobo; the ChangeLog for this change to gtkdoc-scan.inis:===2001-02-20  Michael Meeks  < michael@ximian.com >        * gtkdoc-mktmpl.in: s/TRUE/1/===So it could even be an accidental commit. Special casing of structures whose names end in Class ispretty odd  to begin with, but maybe if we changedthe rule to be: Structures named <Known ObjectName> + Class defualt to  private. It might be an acceptable rule. (Would take care of someof the Pango *Class structures, but probably not theBonobo ones.)GtkStyleClass also needs some public /*< public >*/ actionwith your changes... it used to be special-cased as well.++Special-casing structs based on their name ending in ""Class"" is certainly doubious. If we want to treat these structs differently,the proper way to do it would be to have gtkdoc-scangobj emit alist of class structs.++Michael committed the patch with the ChangeLog you found (rev. 1.15 of gtkdoc-scan.in), but the actual patch is by Miguel. See http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-components-list/2001 -February/msg00076.html++Sorry - no clue; that's about the time I wrote the bonobo docs - whichare now festering in an badly un-maintained fashion which sucks. SoI'd recommend going ahead and fixing the problem properly - andperhaps bonobo will get fixed one day :-)++Michael's 's/TRUE/1' patch was for a silly typo I made, so I don't think that is related to this problem.I think maybe we should default to public for *Class structs, except forthe gtk module where we default to private for now, until someone goesthrough them all.++For gtk it doesn't matter much, since very few class structs arelisted in gtk-sections.txt++Here is a patch which removes most special-casing of class structs,making them default to public like other structs.++Created attachment 13046  [details]  [review] new patch++Committed the patch now."

sebastian.droege@collabora.co.uk >        * Makefile.am:        Add gst-libs to DIST_SUBDIRS to make sure that it's always        disted.        * autogen.sh:        Remove -I m4 from autogen.sh, it's not disted and used anymore and        thus makes autogen.sh fail if run on a tarball. Fixes bug #563305 .++I have verified that the problem is fixed.  I verified this by getting the latest from CVS, making a tarball of 10.6.1 with 'make dist', and building from that tarball.For my particular needs, I think I will continue to build from CVS until an official tarball with this fix is available on gstreamer.freedesktop.org.  In other words I will wait to use this fix until 10.7 is released.  This is just because our build process is restricted to pulling publicly available sources down rather than doing something like building from my own 'homemade' 10.6.1 tarball.Thanks for your prompt fix."
205110,evolution,Mailer,Switching folders [was: Mailer crashed in activity client code],"When I tried recovering from an IMAP message header syncing problem (see bug#205109 ), I went into evolution/mail/imap/<account> and moved my INBOXfolder to something else.

""Generally, there's *not a* single value […]""++Created attachment 178649  [details]  [review] Preliminary patch for bug 535424 I attach a patch that update the documentation for the Since Last Run assistant.The patch is not complete: I don't know exactly what ""Ignored"" and ""Postponed"" do. I also see from po file that there are two strings (""Never"" and ""Need Value"") that comes from the file ""dialog-sx-since-last-run.c"". Do Someone knows what they mean?Finally can someone confirm that the ""value"" column displayed in the Since Last Run assistant is meant to be empty as I understand from previous comments?++Please keep in mind that I am a user and not a developer but here is what I understand on how the scheduled transactions are working.Ignored:If a SX is being displayed, either to be created or as a reminder, the user can set the status to 'Ignored' to skip this event.  The SX will not be entered in the register and the next reminder for this SX will be the next occurrence. For instance, if you have a SX set up with a reminder to transfer $500 at the end of the month to your savings account but you bought yourself a computer this month and don't have the money for this month's transfer then you would set the status to 'Ignored'.Postponed:If a SX has been listed with a status 'To-create' but you want to hold it and not have it entered to your register yet then you would set it to 'Postponed'.(In the past I had problems with this status because it changed the dates of the SX so I stopped using it and reset the status to 'Reminder' instead.)Never:I've never seen this one.Need Value:This is not a status.  This is the string that shows up for a SX that's been entered with a variable.  The variable is then displayed with a place to enter the actual amount.  The initial value for this amount is '(Need Value)'.Value column:I can't confirm that it's *meant* to be empty (it would actually be nice to have the amount of a two-split SX displayed here) but I can confirm that the column is empty except for transactions entered with a variable amount.  The 'Need Value' placeholder is displayed in the value column and once the actual amount has been entered, the value column contains that value.I hope this helps.

Well, since you are more or less the most active documentation maintainer, I'd say this is your call.The last documentation release for 2.2 has been 6 months ago. A lot of the documentation improvements were back ported from trunk to the 2.2 branch.So perhaps a new 2.2 documentation release is a good idea ?In that case IMO the patch in this bug surely makes sense.After this release, we can decide if we wish to continue to work on the 2.2 documentation (considering the limited man power available) or call it the final release and focus on the 2.4 documentation only.++I'm back again to this bug, because backporting the patch to 2.2 will requires more changes than I thought. So I close this bug. With the next GC release, if it's ok, I would like to also release a newer version of documentation due to a lot of modifications and closed bug since the last release. I dont't know how to make a new release but I'm willing to learn but that's another topic...++Cristian, I have opened bug 652350 to discuss the documentation release process further.

Meanwhile I was adviced to try to copy the message from Outbox to Sent Items after successful SubmitMessage call on my own, but it fails as well, with MAPI_E_SUBMITTED error, even the message is still in the Outbox. I've no idea what to do now.++Created attachment 148336  [details]  [review] proposed ema patchfor evolution-mapi;After another discussion with Kerihuel it turned out that the issue with the above ""other approach"" patch was that the obj_message was still there, preventing the message from the movement. Releasing it before move call fixed that.Nonetheless, after some observations, the problem with an Outbox remote folder is kinda big, because Evolution is not using a remote Outbox, but its own local Outbox, under its On This Computer. Thus when SubmitMessage reports an error, the message is kept in the local Outbox, as well as in the remote Outbox, which is obviously wrong. Issue with movement is that the ema's exchange_mapi_create_item returns a message id of a newly created message, but after movement to the Sent Items the message no longer exists, which might cause a trouble and it is not as that simple to get the moved message ID.Thus I decided the approach of storing message to Sent Items folder before submitting, and if the submit fails, then remove it from the Sent Items folder. This might cover all the above mentioned issues and simplifies things quite much.I would like to ask Jony on his thoughts and anyone being able to test this patch on a real environment, with real recipients, to give it a try.

The original issue of the screenshot tool not displaying it's self correctly in mallchin@blueyonder.co.uk 's report has been confirmed as fixed. New bug: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=352379++Created attachment 111946  [details]  [review] Fixes xinerama desktop screenshot to shoot the whole desktopAttach is the patch which fixes the symtom on gnume-utils-2.20.0.1I think this is covering up the root cause of the issue. Which is that XShapeGetRectangles (GDK_DISPLAY() GDK_ROOT_WINDOW(), ...) returns a single rectangle for the root window that is only the first X screen. Either the code that assumes GDK_ROOT_WINDOW() gives you something that represents the entire desktop is incorrect, or XShapeGetRectangles() has a bug. I don't know which, I'm hoping someone on #gtk+ will direct me someplace useful...++Upon reflection I believe this is in fact the correct patch.This situation only comes up when taking a screenshot of the entire desktop. Whatever we do we have to check to see whether this is the GDK_ROOT_WINDOW(). We can do something funky like: screen_count = ScreenCount(GDK_DISPLAY ());for(i = 0; i < screen_count; ++i) {    rectanlges = XShapeGetRectangles (GDK_DISPLAY, RootWindow(GDK_DISPLAY(), i), ShapeBounding, &rectangle_count, &rectangle_order); /* etc... */}I think this would be the wrong way to go. We can't handle non rectangular screens. If there are multiple screens of different sizes & resolutions we are going to have dead regions in the overall screenshot no matter what. Breaking the root window into multiple screens and stitching back together is needless complexity, there's no benefit there, and we have to check if the window passed in is the root window anyway so the patch does the check exactly once and minimises the the  resultant headache.++duplicated by Bug 352379 ?++Created attachment 111970  [details] Screenshot taken after patch applied, c. 650kb++I don't have a xinerama set up, so I can't confirm this works. if it doesn't cause any regression I can apply, but I'd like confirmation by at least another user that the patch works.++Just tried out the attached patch, on OpenSolaris with gnome 2.24 stack installedand running xinerama, and this does indeed display the complete captured screen.++Created attachment 119618  [details]  [review] updated patch to apply with gnome-utils 2.24.0Updated patch to apply against the latest 2.24.0 code.++*** Bug 352379 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++Created attachment 128346  [details]  [review] bgo166485-screenshot-randr-blank-areas.diffWe also need this patch to blank out the invisible areas for non-rectangular multi-monitor setups.

Due to this, a resource may accept a URI   without a trailing ""/"" to point to a collection. In this case it   SHOULD return a content-location header in the response pointing to   the URI ending with the ""/"".  For example, if a client invokes a   method on http://foo.bar/blah (no trailing slash), the resource http://foo.bar/blah/ (trailing slash) may respond as if the operation   were invoked on it, and should return a content-location header with http://foo.bar/blah/ in it.  In general clients SHOULD use the ""/""   form of collection names.I believe that this describes the exact behaviour of Apple's server, and Evolution should not be arbitrarily trifling with the URLs people give it (and don't get me started on the whole ""caldav://"" thing :-)Regards,Andrew McMillan.++Created attachment 123360  [details]  [review] proposed eds patchfor evolution-data-server;In code before the patch the trailing slash has been always removed from the user's uri.

There have been a couple more changes yesterday.  The CVS version should compile against 0.12.0 and 0.11.8 API versions.Can the original problem be reproduced with the current gnome-pilot CVS?By the way, if verifying this bug I strongly recommend compiling pilot-linkfrom the current CVS version.Thanks.++Hi,MattThe original problem isn't reporducible with the current gnome-pilot CVS.

If so, then putting in a short (say 1-second) delay in gpilotd after a successful sync might be sufficient.2. A better alternative, if it works, might be to apply the pilot-link patch I posted to bug 1585 on bugs.pilot-link.org: http://bugs.pilot-link.org/file_download.php?file_id=592&type=bug and then a non-zero timeout should work properly.++I think I've found the cause of the gpilotd freeze.  Do you have more than one configured USB 'device'?  (i.e. perhaps one 'pilot' but two 'devices' in the capplet)I've been able to reproduce this by using the gpilotd-control-applet to configure a second 'device' that watches the ttyUSB device.  After the first sync completes, gpilotd tries to sync the second configured device, but the palm has signed off.The simple fix is to prevent gpilotd trying to sync more than one USBdevice.  A proper fix would be to enforce the 'single USB device' conditionin the capplet, but that's not a one-liner and the visor module stuffis due to be ripped out at some stage so I'm not going to spend too longon this right now.Jerry, can you verify that this patch fixes the problem:--- gpilotd.c.~1.146.~	2006-03-06 20:21:16.000000000 +0000+++ gpilotd.c	2006-03-13 20:52:31.000000000 +0000@@ -955,6 +955,7 @@ visor_devices_timeout (gpointer data)   				if (!visor_net) 					device->type = PILOT_DEVICE_USB_VISOR;+				break; /* don't try to sync any more devices! */ 			} 			l = l->next; 		}++Hi,MattThe answer is no. There's only one configured device in capplet.I have done a test to the two patches you mentioned above, one for pilot-link and the other for gnome-pilot. It is a pity that both of them can't resolve the problem.++Hi Jerry,That's a shame that the patches don't fix it.  You could try adding a short sleep() after the sync completes (where the 'break' statement was added) to see if that sorts it out.  My suspicion is that gpilotd is attempting a further sync immediately after finishing the first sync.  This can happen if there are multiple configured devices, but I guess it could also happen if the USB device persists for a short period after the sync completes.++Update: I have added a couple of sleeps to avoid attempting a new sync immediately after completing one which I believe fixes this issue.See if the 2.0.14pre5 tarball fixes this bug.See: http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mcdavey/downloads/ ++Jerry, can you verify whether or not the 'pre5' tarball makes the backup conduit reliable for you?++Any update?++Matt, sorry for missing these updates. I'll test it soon.++Matt, I had a test using the 'pre5' tarball , it worked fine.++Excellent.  Closing."

597159,orca,general,Orca does not provide access to the contents of Packagemanager's HTML container,"Packagemanager currently presents the start page in an HTML container. Orca does not provide access to the information therein. In addition, d.o.o. 11669 [1] causes helpful information to be presented in an HTML container when a user has chosen Search All Publishers.

Thanks!~~~Once focus has been moved to the HTML container (using Shift+Tab or Ctrl+L), and F7 has been pressed to enable the caret, the attached will cause Orca to present the text for the current accessible. As a result, *most* lines should be presented correctly.Still to be addressed:- We will need to assemble the text for lines in which there is formatting and/or links as these are rendered in separate (and non-focused) accessibles.

It's needed because we're getting a caret-moved event for the object being left rather than the object the caret just moved to. *sigh*Isolated, pylinted, committed to both master and the gnome-2-28 branch.++I believe I have now done just about all I can on this bug. Things which seem out of our hands:1. Given a multi-column table (such as the one found on the PM home page), pressing Down Arrow at the bottom of the first column will not move you to the second column. This has nothing to do with Orca.Solutions I tried:a. Change the PM start page in a variety of fashions (restructure the table, use CSS for layout rather than a table). Didn't make a difference.b. Use RELATION_FLOWS_{TO,FROM} as a way to validate a given caret-moved event and, if we detected text being skipped, reposition the caret. This fails because gtkthml2 does not support setCaretOffset. I also tried doing a grabFocus on the component. gtkhtml2 doesn't support that either.Fortunately the search results pages don't suffer from this. Hopefully additional content added by the pkg gui guys will not either.2. You cannot arrow laterally into a link from a non link. If you Tab to a link you can then arrow in it. If you arrow vertically into a link you can then arrow in it.Solutions I tried: Same as above. We cannot set the caret offset and we cannot do a grab focus. Also, hypothetically speaking, if we wanted to be really ugly, you'd think we could synthesize a keyboard event (i.e. Tab) and then deal with the character navigation. Turns out even this won't work because the Tab order in gtkhtml2 ignores the caret position. :-/Fortunately, reading the content by Up and Down Arrow and using Tab/Shift+Tab to move amongst links will likely be the more common user interaction.3. Alt and title attributes for images are not exposed to us. In addition, images are exposed as ROLE_PANEL rather than ROLE_IMAGE. This goes for images which are links too. The accessible hyperlink interface is not implemented either. If you Tab to an image link, Orca just says ""link"". Fortunately, there aren't too many of these.That said, all things being equal, Orca's presentation of the PM HTML container actually seems pretty decent now. Really. :-) And when things are migrated over to WebKit the above should hopefully become non-issues."

It would mean not cluttering $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR with a bunch of at-spi2-* directories, though maybe that doesn't really matter much...As far as unlinking the socket goes, my patch adds an unlink into deregister_application, but that requires that something call atk_bridge_adaptor_cleanup, which gtk+ currently does not do. I'm not sure we've finalized that API, though, so it might make sense to convert it to creating a GObject, then patch gtk+, etc. to ensure that it gets dereferenced.++Committed the patch with some modifications: e4f3ee."

So what I propose is using a similar solution the evolutionmail composer uses for “To:” fields.

What distro+version are you using?This is going to be a very helpful bug, in terms of improving our error dialogs.  Your feedback is very much appreciated!  :-)++Ok, I did this:sudo usermod -G fuse -a nxand a new login. After that, the connection seemd to work, I got the ""you are now connected"" popup window.But when trying to sync:[DEBUG]: SyncThread using SyncServiceAddin: SSH (sshfs FUSE)[DEBUG]: Exception while creating SyncServer: /home/nx/.tomboy/sync-sshfs  at Tomboy.Sync.FileSystemSyncServer..ctor (System.String localSyncPath) [0x00000]   at Tomboy.Sync.FuseSyncServiceAddin.CreateSyncServer () [0x00000]   at Tomboy.Sync.SyncManager.SynchronizationThread () [0x00000]++Hmm, that's strange.  That error should only happen when the specified sync directory does not exist.  In this case, Tomboy is using sshfs to mount the share you want to /home/nx/.tomboy/sync-sshfs and then it is trying to sync to that location.  But for some reason the path does not exist.  I cannot reproduce this.In the ssh sync preferences, do you have a setting for ""Folder""?  If not, try creating a directory on your ssh server and putting that directory name in (relative to your ssh home directory, or you can use absolute paths).So for example, I want to sync to my server named t2, user name ""sandy"", and I have a sync folder located at ""/home/sandy/sync"" on t2.  So I enter:server: t2Folder (optional): syncUsername: sandyI think we should make the Folder mandatory instead of optional.  It probably isn't a good idea to be syncing directly to your ssh home directory, since we do so much file manipulation in the designated sync directory.Let me know if this changes anything.++Just a note: I had no trouble using ssh sync with no Folder specified.++Hmm... strange. In fact I had a ""sync"" folder on the ssh server and I put /home/monreal/sync into the folder field. Now I tried with just sync, it worked perfectly. Then I tried with /home/monreal/sync again... and guess what, it still works...But after a restart, tomboy asks again for the password. Is it not using the keyring? Or is this releated to the problems getting the pass to the sshfs client?++I'm glad that it is now working for you...if it fails oddly again definitely let us know.Tomboy is not touching the ssh password at all; it never sees it, and it never stores it.  You will need to set up an ssh key and use ssh-add or seahorse or something (there are many tutorials out there) to add the key to an authentication agent.  That should help you avoid the bizarre password prompt.  We'll be setting up documentation on the wiki ASAP to help everyone with these sorts of scenarios. For another approach, you could always use sshfs by itself to set up your mount when you log in, and then use the filesystem sync backend to connect to your mount.If you use the WebDAV sync backend, we do store all of your connection information (including password) in the GNOME keyring.++Setting up the ssh access with seahorse was very easy! Thanks! (and see my other bug about tomboy crashing now ;)++More UI improvements would be nice, but I've done all I have time for before UI freeze.  In 0.7.4 users will see a more explanatory SSH sync configuration widget.  The error dialogs do not have any more specifics, though.  Users will have to check console output or tomboy.log to see more specific warnings/errors.Closing this bug for now."

240852,evolution,Mailer,Clarify keyboard shortcuts for Next/Prev by adding them to menu item names,"Since Evolution 1.2, the ""Go to next unread message"" and ""Go to previousunread message"" operations have had their keyboard shortcuts changed. Theynow are ] and [ respectively.Since these shortcuts (together with the shortcuts ""Send"", ""Forward"", andother shortcuts for common operations) are probably the most commonly usedin a mailer, this change is a really bad one, at least for everyone withouta US/UK keyboard layout.On many international keyboard layouts, the [ and ] characters are composedcharacters that require simultaneous pressing of the AltGr key. This istrue for the Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, Spain,Sweden, and Germany layouts, in short almost all non-English keyboardlayouts I have access to. The only one where this isn't true is theNetherlands one, where ] is on a normal key and [ is aquired by pressingShift on the same key.As my hands have started to hurt after repeatedly twisting them to usethese new shortcuts, and that this isn't unlikely to happen to many usersof the most common Evolution keyboard shortcuts that happen to not use anUS/UK layout, I've raised the priority on this one.++See also bug 227853 ++,. are also shortcuts, because on most keyboards they have < and >keycaps printed on them.This has changed because the letter keys are supposed to navigate youaround to different places in the message list or folder tree. It's not going to change. Sorry.++> ,. are also shortcuts, because on most keyboards they have < and >> keycaps printed on them. Nice, didn't know that. Neither do I think most other users know aboutit. Perhaps it's those shortcuts that should be printed next to themenu items instead.As for ""most keyboards"", I wonder where that statement comes from. Tothe best of my knowledge only the US and UK layouts have < and > on ,and . respectively. > This has changed because the letter keys are supposed to navigate > you around to different places in the message list or folder tree. > > It's not going to change. Sorry. Why not list , and . instead as the primary shortcuts in the menu?While these keys aren't located on the same places either on everylayout, they are located on the same, non-modified place on many morelayouts. They have the same location on the US, UK, Denmark, Italy,Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, and Germany layouts.Only Belgium and France are exceptions, where these keys are locatedone step to the left and . requires the use of Shift. But they are alot easier to access on far many more layouts than the obscure [ and ].++Good point. Have changed summary to reflect this. (Also, this should be a trivial enhancement)++Excellent. Thanks a lot for looking into this.++Moving to correct component and adding myself to the cc: list.++We can't put , and . as the keys that show up on the menuitems, due tothe way keybindings in gtk+ work. Putting them on the list would meanthat one could no longer type them into the search bar. They are, Ibelieve, referenced in the manual, and are also now in the quickreference card, in 1.5. The keybindings that show up in the menus,must be modifier sequences. Alt+Right/Left might be useful as well. Ifsomeone with a sufficient knowledge of different keyboard layouts,could make suggestions for all of the keyboard accels in evolution,that would be very useful. There are other problems, besides just thisone.++So, can we put [ and ] as the shortcuts?And where should a gtk+ bug be filed to cover the fact that gtk+ menushortcuts are broken in the way you describe?++[ and ] are shortcuts in the same way that , and . are, now anyway.The menuitems have been updated to show Ctrl-[/] for those.It isn't a bug in gtk+. It is just how things work. We should neverhave keybindings that are a single printable character anyway. It ishorrible practice. Non-printable characters can be used without amodifier, though.If one were to file a bug against gtk+ though, it would have to be puton the 2.6+ timeframe, and all of the keybinding handling would haveto be re-done. Until then, it is going to have to stay as it is.++Well. We have C-[/] and the like in the menus, and we have the quickreference pdf thing. I think this is sufficient for calling this fixed."

You're probably right about the race thing, since with the same error message, I get two different behaviors depending on the mood of gstreamer and totem. The error message is always:""Totem could not play 'file:///home/[name].avi'. Internal data flow error.""First possible behavior: Once I press OK, I can switch off the subs in view->subtitles and press play so it will play. At this point totem outputs:** (totem:6206): WARNING **: Error: Internal data flow error. (gstbasesrc.c(1569): gst_base_src_loop (): /play/subtitle-bin/filesrc4:streaming task paused, reason not-linked (-1))But it plays fine.If now I want the subs back, I just activate them through view->subtitles again and they work.Funny thing here is that if I didn't switch the subs off after the first error and pressed play, this other error happens: ""An error occurred. Internal data flow error"". After this the behavior is the same described above.Second behavior: Once I press OK, subtitles submenu in view is deactivated, so I can't switch them off and hence, every time I try to play, the same first error raises again.It seems that some files are more prone to produce either of these behaviors, but, on my experience, *every* movie that I want to play with subtitles produce this Internal data flow error. The difference is sometimes I can play the trick on the first behavior and watch the movie and sometimes I just can't watch it with subtitles.Anyway, there's not a deterministic pattern on which behavior a movie will observe but, as I said, some files are more prone to either of those.I'm using Totem 2.16.2 with GStreamer 0.10.10If there's some way I can help to resolve this bug, please let me know. It is frustrating to have to fight totem every time I want to play a subtitled movie.++As Ali Sabil pointed out in the Launchpad.net bug report ( https://launchpad.net/totem/+bug/70223 ), it is possible to actually play the movie *with* subtitles if you do a fast triple-click on the ""Play"" button before the error dialog box appears. Does this help finding the source of the bug?++I get this bug too and triple clicking on ""Play"" does make it play successfully.++I'm using decodebin2 element that added gst-plugins-base 0.10.11, via set USE_DECODEBIN2 shell variable.and never happened that raise popup dialog.but sometimes, play status went invalid. Play control button and statusbar showed media was played, but media was not played.and press Right arrow key (for skip 1 minute forward), just played properly.++I have the same problem in Gnome 2.17.92 with libgstreamer 0.10.11cvs20070222.

383000,lsr,core,Some visible text skipped when reviewing in Firefox,"Some text gets skipped when using the review keys in Firefox. This especially happens when reading a paragraph with other objects embedded in it. Bug is likely in AccessibleItemWalker or in HypertextAdapter. If not, bug could be in the way FF3 is reporting next/prev item.++Created attachment 78720  [details] test webpage that illustrates problem++The test webpage (see attachments) demonstrates the problem.  Here are some observations: 1. The paragraph (<p>) is offset by an acc.item_offset number of characters.   2. The bug occurs when the <div> is included before the <p>. 3. The bug does not occur if <p> is replaced by <span>. 4. The bug is most likely in HypertextAdapter.getNextItem().  <span>s filter through the last else while <p> filter through the second if. 5.  Before HypertextAdapter.getNextItem() the por item_offset is 0, after the method the item_offset is 127.++The use of item_offset in hypertext mimicks text controls in a sense. The item_offset is the starting character for a ""chunk"" of text. In this case, the ""chunk"" is some child accessible indicated by the unicode embed character (0xfffe). So what you're seeing in #5 might be the correct behavior for the next POR. The first chunk of hypertext spans characters 0 through 126. Then there's probably an embed (e.g. a link) at character 127. Following that there might be more text, so the next POR might be POR(hypertext acc, 128, 0).Keep in mind whether review visible items is on or off during your tests. You'll get different results in each case. This bug is about making the review keys behavior properly when reviewing visible items only.++> I saw your recent comments about 383000.

Please post the text as shown by at-poke for each of the nodes in the accessible hierarchy under the document frame? I don't have convenient access to FF3 right now. > Another observation is that the ""document frame"" acc passes> HypertextAdapter.when().  This doesn't seem right. The document frame almost always has embed characters representing the top level elements, which means it counts as hypertext. In your case, I bet it has two: one for the div and the other paragraph.

The fudge factor applied to getExtents() use to create a clipping of the textbox resulting in missing lines of text.  The fudge factor now allows getOffsetAtPoint() to ""see"" the entire textbox.  Hopefully, this change does not affect browsing of textboxes in other areas.  The question arises,  Why have a fudge factor?++The fudge factor was added to account for list, table, and tree controls that have a border. If use the getAccessibleAtPoint call with a coordinate that falls on the border, the return value was None in some cases. We added a fudge factor of a few pixels to move in from the border so the call returns one of the list items.This may or may not be a problem anymore. AT-SPI might have been updated to account for visual borders. The border problem may also not exist for text boxes.Test this patch in a few multiline text boxes. gedit and gnome-terminal are good test cases. Report on the results here. I'll apply the patch if it works properly.++Created attachment 78793  [details] files to demonstrate <p> cropping bug++Test results.  See attached html test files.

Committing the patch.++Switching the fudge factors from +/- may have fixed the problem, but I'm not sure if it was just a side effect or the true solution. When looking for the first character, the fudge factor should be added, not subtracted, because the 0,0 coordinate is in the top left corner of the screen. For the last character, it should be subtracted, not added, because xmax, ymax is in the lower right.I'm leaving this patch in place, but I need an explanation as to why it's working. I'm seeing weird behavior when reviewing visible items in gnome-terminal now, and I wonder if it's a result of this change or some other change in the code.Plus, I suspect there are still problems with how getOffsetAtPoint is working in Firefox. This patch may have worked around those bugs, but I think the real problem lies deeper. See the comments in bug #382998 .++Questions from Scott: > Does the GTerminal weirdness occur when the change is backed out? Yes. The terminal weirdness was the result of another bug. > Can you give me an example of the problem in GTerminal?  Is it simply review key errors? It had to do with continuous reading which I now fixed. > I will test with no fudge factor.  Was the origin of the fudge factor related to problems in the tree and list type elements? Unknown. I'm unclear as to how it works either way in text fields. Given the x,y coordinate one of 1) adding a fudge factor or 2) subtracting a fudge factor should work while the other should not. What's weird is that they both appear to be working.The current TextAdapter arithmetic (the one specified in the last patch on this bug) is contrary to all other adapters that add/subtract fudge factors. Some experimentation using at-poke also seems to suggest that the new patch is adding when it should be subtracting and vice versa. For instance, scrolling a web page down decreases the y coordinate indicating that y=0 is at the top of the screen. Therefore, when testing for the first character in a rectangular region, we want to move down a few pixels to find it.++Created attachment 80074  [details]  [review] patch for Some visible text skipped when reviewing in FirefoxFirefox Component::getExtents() returns screen coordinates when requesting both screen and window coordinates.  Text::getOffsetAtPoint() now uses screen coordinates as a work around to the Firefox bug.++Additional informationtext.getOffsetAtPoint() may return -1 if the point is outside the bounds.  This is contrary to what has been seen in gedit where 0 or max is returned.++Patch rejected in favor of overlapping changes in patch for bug #395584 .Fixed in the development version.

So this patch is definitely wrong.  Sounds to me more likely that there's a bug in bonobo_arg_new: it seems to be returning a BonoboArg with some filled in value, when it should be returning an empty value (like its documentation says).++Created attachment 73705  [details]  [review] cleanup bonobo_arg_newThis patch cleans up bonobo_arg_new() and in the process I hope also fixes the leak, but needs testing.  I only tested with the unit tests, and they don't show memory leaks, unfortunately :P++Thanks for your patch.  It works for me, and it doesn't leak memory any more.++good catch - basically you can't create a 'String' any without having an allocated string in it.The patch to fix is good, but let's move the CORBA_free into the conditional that we use to set it, I'd have to leave a broken Any around in the error case.Good stuff.++Michael, I'm still reluctant about the CORBA_free.  What if it's passed in uninitialized memory, as in this example:{{{BonoboArg any;CORBA_char *string;any._type = TC_CORBA_string;any._release = CORBA_FALSE;any._value = &string;bonobo_arg_from_gvalue(&any, some_string_gvalue);}}}The documentation is not entirely clear on whether or not this is acceptable.  ORBit2 allocations are safe because they often use g_malloc0, but that is not the general rule outside ORBit2...Maybe we should just clarify in the documentation that passing uninitialized memory (from stack or malloc) to bonobo_arg_from_gvalue is not allowed; then it will be safe to add the CORBA_free.  Unless of course there is already broken code out there in the wild... :|++um - that looks broken.What I would do is - grok all instances of the call in evolution/gnome as a whole and decide what to do :-) I -imagine- it won't hurt anyone - and there is really no other solution that I can see.++grepping through binaries and libraries, it seems only gtkhtml3 uses bonobo_arg_from_gvalue, but it does so in a safe way.I was looking in libbonobo itself for usages of bonobo_arg_from_gvalue, and found this in bonobo-property-bag.c, function impl_Bonobo_PropertyBag_getValues:	for (curr = props; curr != NULL; curr = curr->next) {		BonoboProperty *prop = curr->data;		BonoboArg *arg;		set->_buffer [set->_length].name =  			CORBA_string_dup (prop->name);		bonobo_closure_invoke (prop->priv->get_prop,				       BONOBO_TYPE_STATIC_CORBA_ANY,       &arg,				       BONOBO_TYPE_PROPERTY_BAG,           pb,				       BONOBO_TYPE_STATIC_CORBA_TYPECODE,  prop->type,				       G_TYPE_UINT,                        prop->idx,				       BONOBO_TYPE_STATIC_CORBA_EXCEPTION, ev,				       G_TYPE_INVALID);		set->_buffer [set->_length].value = *arg;		set->_length++;	}get_prop is defined as:get_prop (BonoboPropertyBag *bag,	  BonoboArg         *arg,	  guint              arg_id,	  CORBA_Environment *ev,	  gpointer           user_data)Now, I could be reading this wrong, but isn't impl_Bonobo_PropertyBag_getValues buggy?  The parameter ""&arg"" has the type (BonoboArg **), yet get_prop receives (BonoboArg *).  It then calls bonobo_arg_from_gvalue (arg, &new);  This looks like a bug to me, regardless of any patch applied to fix a memory leak...++Any news on this? Michael?++sure - lets commit the fix :-) it's Gustavo's call really.++Actually I am now more worried about a possible memory error in impl_Bonobo_PropertyBag_getValues, but I'll look again more closely to that soon...++Well, I applied my patch and things still work.

The user may wish to do otherthings such as move the GOK window, go to Compose, etc. as well, oractivate some other window while the alert is posted (which ispossible for some alerts even if they are modal).++It is certainly true that the user may want to do something other thanread the alert and dismiss it, but I suggest that in > 80% of thesituations, reading and dismissing is what the user will want to do.

We shouldprobably simply ask the users at UToronto what they think (or thedevelopers closest to those users) to see whether they feel this wouldbe a good addition to GOK or not...++Just to make sure we are on the same page.  If an alert comes up, thesuggestion is basically to branch to a gok keyboard which has a keyfor each button widget on the alert?  If so, I think this *is* usefulbut should remain low priority...

Hence the priority I suggested for thisbug...  And I do like your suggestion of a more general kind of logicfor proffering the most likely desired keyboard for any givensituation.

I know there is no charset info on the stream to begin with because it's usual case by shoutcast and icecast streamings - the info is conditional by spec. But, because I can guess those songs tagged with Korean, starting istream given with LANG=ko_KR.euckr brings song's title look OK.But, problem is with normal starting of the istream, this is because, I looked, that icydemux's magling functions try to convert,1) $LANG to UTF-82) iso8859-1 to UTF-8 if 1) failed.As you may see now, 1) mine is already UTF-8 and it doesn't match with song's tagging charset(cp949) either, 2) makes more trouble - cp949 can't be iso8859-1.I think, this is a common problem to at least for CJK (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) users who use their UTF-8 system and listen streaming station running on Windows so maybe already filed for bug. But, I am new here and this is my first bug report to Gnome so wasn't familiar to check duplications. Steps to reproduce:1. install the istream panel applet2. edit ~/.istream file to add this entry to top, mukulcast (KPop)= http://mukulcast.com 3. play the mukulcast, after openings you will see unreadable song's title for Korean. Actual results:Title of songs can't be readable for Korean.Expected results:No matter I start the istream applet with or without LANG env set, the title should be readable for Korean.Does this happen every time?Yes.Other information:I looked, http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=428689 this patch maybe targeted for files, but the idea of the patch generally fix this problem too if it's for icydemux, I believe.

125406,gnopernicus,general,gnopernicus magnifier doesn't always follow focus,"gnopernicus' magnifier focus-tracking seems intermittent.  Under someconditions it only sporadically follows the focus events sent to it byat-spi.  At the moment I am seeing this when an 'inaccessible' applicationis also resident on the desktop, but it may happen in other situations. The 'inaccessible' app is not expected to focus-track, of course, but focustracking in 'accessible' apps seems to be broken if focus moves from theinaccessible application into the accessible one.For instance, if one is running gnopernicus, gnome-cd, and an xterm, whenmoving from the xterm to gnome-cd via Alt-TAB, sometimes focus tracking ingnome-cd doesn't work afterwards.  At other times it does; so cycling tognome-cd several times via Alt-TAB will, eventually, cause the magnifier'sfocus tracking to start working again in the magnifier.  (Note that I amreferring to keynav-style keyboard focus tracking, not mouse following).To reproduce:Run gnome-cd, gnopernicus, and xterm.  Move to gnopernicus, press arrowkeys or TAB to see the magnifier track oncsreen focus.  Press Alt-TAB tofocus xterm; as one expects the magnifier doesn't follow focus in thexterm.  Press Alt-TAB one or more times to focus gnome-cd; press arrow keysor TAB; note that sometimes the magnifier re-centers to show gnome-cd asexpected, and recenters when necessary as TAB or arrow keys are pressed,but sometimes it does not.++Bill, are you sure that no part of current focused object is onmagnifier. I tried to reproduce it, but with no results.++I am not able to reproduce the above scenario, please provide moreinformation.I will explain how the magnifier focus tracking is NOW working ingnopernicus:The focus tracking is following the focus object. -If the bounding rectangle of the focus object are already magnifiedand totally visible then the magnified area won't move.-If the focus object is clipped to the left (so only its right part isvisible) then the magnified area will move to the left, making thefocused object to be inside the magnified area. -If the focus object is clipped to the right (so only its left part isvisible) then the magnified area will move to the right, making thefocused object to be inside the magnified area. -If the focus object is clipped on the top (so only its bottom part isvisible) then the magnified area will move up, making the focusedobject to be inside the magnified area. -If the focus object is clipped on the bottom (so only its top part isvisible) then the magnified area will move down, making the focusedobject to be inside the magnified area.-If the focus object is out (not visible at all) then the magnifiedarea will move in such way that the movement will be the minimum.The algorithm described here is similar to the ""push"" mode of the""mouse tracking"", so the focus-tracking won't be jerky.Note that there is an RFE ( bug #124641 ) and gnopernicus will implementa centered-focus-tracking mode, too.++I understand the various tracking algorithms; however the case I amreferring to is where gnopernicus does not include thecurrently-focussed component anywhere in the magnifier window. As I said the problem is intermittent but reproducible on my system; Ican now reproduce this with ONLY gnome-cd and gnopernicus on thescreen (aside from the panel of course).  I have not yet seen itwithout gnome-cd running, so possibly there is an influence from thetoo-frequent window-title-changed messages from gnome-cd.  I am using default gnopernicus magnification settings, i.e. 2x by 2x,vertical half-screen magnification. I am using GNOME default font size(11 point I think).To reproduce: launch gnopernicus (with brlmonitor and speech, andmagnification as above).  Launch gnome-cd.Place gnopernicus and gnome-cd windows in full view on the left sideof the screen, as far from one another as practical. Move focus ineach application to a button (for instance gnopernicus '4 - minimize'and gnome-cd 'preferences') Switch focus via Alt-TAB; magnifier willcorrectly re-center so that the focussed button is on-screen for eachapplication as you switch back and forth..Repeat several times; it doesn't have to be _too_ fast, but I findthat the problem is more likely to happen if you hold the Alt key downfor a long-ish time (1 second?), then press and release TAB veryquickly once, releasing Alt at almost the same time.  The thing thatseems to make the problem more likely is a very short time between therelease of TAB and the release of Alt.  After 5 or 6 times switchingback and forth, eventually things will get out of sync and themagnifier will stay focussed on the wrong item until another anotherfocus event occurs due to user action.Screen resolution is 1024x768 on my system but I doubt this is of anyconsequence for this bug.++I was able to reproduce the bug with gnome-cd and gnome-terminalapplications, inspected by simple-at program.Event flow proves that sometimes the focused object for gnome-cd andanother accessible application is not well reported.For instance this is the log in case of making an ALT-TAB to theTerminal. An event from gnome-cd is reported afterwards even if thefocus (graphically displayed) is on the terminal.object:visible-data-changed event receivedobject:visible-data-changed event receivedobject:visible-data-changed event receivedobject:visible-data-changed event receivedfocus: event from Terminalfocus: event from Track editorobject:visible-data-changed event receivedobject:visible-data-changed event receivedobject:visible-data-changed event receivedAttached to this bug is the test-program that I used and the log thatI obtained.So IMHO, this is a problem in the way focus events are reported byat-spi to gnopernicus.++Created attachment 21059  [details] Test program++Created attachment 21060  [details] Log that I obtained with the test-program inspecting gnome-cd and gnome-terminal (switching between these 2 apps)++OK, so we now know that the root cause of the problem is eventreordering/ordering.However we know for certain that since these events are coming fromdifferent processes, we cannot fix that issue.Therefore I think we should look into how we might work around thisbug in gnopernicus (and/or at-spi?).  For instance, if we detect""skew"" between focus events and currently-active window, we could takeappropriate action.  Similarly, in the case you specifically mentionabove, it may be that the focus event from the cdplayer isinappropriate and can be detected and discarded either in gnopernicusor at-spi.Another possibility might be that gnopernicus could have an idlehandler or timeout-handler which did a sanity check on last-focussedobject versus FOCUSSED state, and correct any inconsistencies.++Would event timestamps solve this problem?  If so, can we introduce such a timestamp without making an API change (I don't expect so, but I have to ask...)?++I seriously doubt that timestamps would help here.  The timing/orderuncertainty is not just in the delivery, it's in the initiation ofnotification by the application/toolkit itself.  Therefore the eventsmight well have timestamps that correspond to the order Adi reports,i.e. timestamps would also be reversed.++Event ordering is to be done in at-spi (at-spi has to provide a goodevent flow). Gnopernicus' job is to filter events.Bill said: ""Therefore I think we should look into how we might workaround this bug in gnopernicus (and/or at-spi?).  For instance, if wedetect ""skew"" between focus events and currently-active window, wecould take appropriate action.  Similarly, in the case youspecifically mention above, it may be that the focus event from thecdplayer is inappropriate and can be detected and discarded either ingnopernicus or at-spi""Why should gnopernicus workaround?? The ""skew"" could be detected inat-spi, too, as Bill says at the end of the phrase.In my opinion this is an at-spi bug.++I do not actually believe that this is something we should fix inat-spi; it's in the final analysis not fixable there.at-spi cannot reorder the events without causing latency problems. Likwise, at-spi cannot suppress the events without breaking clientswho expect to get the events (without depending on the order).We have always said that at-spi cannot guarantee the order of eventdelivery.  So your assertion that at-spi must do event ordering isn'tcorrect.++changing summary back since it describes the symptom we wish toaddress.  We know that the underlying cause is in the event ordering,but the event ordering issue cannot be solved in the general case. Therefore we must focus on symptomatic relief.++Created attachment 21408  [details]  [review] proposed patch++Bill, can you check if the patch above solves problem described by you?++Hi Remus:This patch appears to fix the problem, glad it was so simple.

113313,libgnomecanvas,core,Gnome canvas confused by updates in handlers crossing events,"I have noticed this both in 2.2 and 2.3.  The fix is for the CVS head, but should apply easily to other branches.  Symptoms: see bug 106145 .  The ""fifteen"" sample doesn't move its pieces when you click on them.  Not only that, but nothing on the canvas will redisplay update until you minimise/maximise or leave the window.  You can also make it work again by commenting out the code that causes the numbers to highlight white once you put the mouse over them.  You can also cause an explicit redraw.  Both of these fix the symptoms, not the problems.  This also manifests itself in our (internal/non-public) project, in a similar manner.  Problem:  The canvas is getting confused.  During its do_update() method, it causes the following steps to take place: 1.  Invoke updates to the root group; 2.  Clear the needs_update flag; 3.  Keep picking  a new item until we don't need to anymore; 4.  Paint if we can.  The problem comes if due to the processing in step 3 (which causes the ENTER and LEAVE events to be generated), the objects need to be updated again.  This causes the needs_update flag to be set again, and we fall off the end of the do_update() method without the updates being finished.  The no-update behaviour is caused by this: once the needs_update flag is set, it will never schedule another do_update even if there isn't one scheduled.  In the case of the fifteen game, the exact mechanism by which a tile didn't move after clicking it was as follows: 1.  Button is clicked.  This causes a move on the tile, which causes an update to be scheduled. 2.  The scheduled update is run.  This causes the tile to be updated, as it should be. 3.  The need_update flag is cleared. 4.  It runs the picker.  This notices that the tile no longer contains the cursor, and sends it a LEAVE event. 5.  In the leave event, the tile unhighlights its number.  This causes the need_update flag to be set again. 6.  The repaint function is called, but each time it calls gnome_canvas_paint_rect() it gets returns straight away since need_update is true.  Hence nothing happens. 7.  We finish the function with need_update and need_redraw true, but with no idle handler to run them again.  Any other updating notices also that need_update is set, and so doesn't add another one.  Solution: See attached patch (against CVS head 19 May 2003).  Essentially update and pick in a loop until there is no more work that needs to be done.

Possibly an alignment/endianness/64-bitissue.++Since I didn't see this at all with Nautilus 1.0.4 and ORBit 0.5.10, Itried going back to ORBit 0.5.10 with 1.0.5.  Problem still there. So, FWIW, it looks like Nautilus 1.0.5 does something differently from1.0.4 that exposes this bug, wherever it is.I also tried the brand-new oaf 0.6.7 and bonobo 1.0.13 (grabbing atstraws), no help.When I run this under gdb, it doesn't hang the machine at all (it justcrashes nicely), so I'm willing to try any suggestions...++We saw bugs like this in oaf on HP-UX.My feeling is that there is a _possibility_ that the problem is thatwe should be generating different stubs / skels on differentarchitectures.Worse - many packages ( although not bonobo ) distribute theirgenerated -stubs and -common and -skels. This causes much hassle, infact it's quite hard not to distribute them - you have to have bits ofautomake magic etc.So ... as a first pass, I would suggest fixing any packages thataccidentaly ship generated IDL - this might include nautilus, gconf etc.You need a fragment a little like this:dist-hook:	cd $(distdir) ; rm -f $(CORBA_BUILT_FILES)To test the hypothesis, try touching all the .idl files, and removingall the -stubs / -skels files.++I tried Michael's suggestion.  oaf and gnome-libs seem to ship withgenerated IDL.  Fixing and recompiling didn't change the memoryallocation problem.  Nautilus itself seems to be ok.Should I try anything else?++I've installed ORBit 0.5.12, bonobo 1.0.14, and gal 0.17...still noluck.  As a guess, I ran nautilus with --no-xshm and it still failed,but the backtrace was somewhat different:0xfe539ab8 in __sigprocmask ()(gdb) bt++++This is probably the initial cause of the memory starvation then. Ifyou can repeat this nicely, can you hack oaf-stubs.c by hand ( becareful not to touch the IDL after this ) and add some g_warnings.We need to ensure that the endianness is right; so put a g_warning inboth endianness paths flagging them. We _should_ be going down the'same endianness path' - the latter cleaner looking code.Then; it would be best to unguard the ORBit/src/IIOP/giop-msg-buffer.c(giop_recv_dump) method, and call that inside the stub - as soon as weget the return buffer. It would also be _great_ to do a:printf (""0x%x "", len); before each CORBA_string_alloc (len) in the stub.With that we have a decent chance of seeing the problem in action;can you do that for me ?++1. Put in the g_warnings - think I can handle that.2. Unguard the giop_revc_dump method - can you explain this more?3. Put in printf's - can do.++Ok, at first I was confused because oaf-stubs.c is in liboaf, not inORBit.  As a quick first step, I put in the printf's and tried it.

I moved the existing Inbox directory out of the way. When Irestarted Evolution the Inbox was recreated. The same behavior occuredwhile attempting the check mail.2. I then moved the entire evolution directory out the the way. When Irestarted Evolution the directory tree was recreated. The originalerror message did not show up.

223449,evolution,Mailer,Config pages for Exchange,"We need config pages for Exchange. The way this works now isvery confusing.The user should specify his windows username and the name ofthe Exchange server. The code can then send an HTTP request tothe server and use the NTLM data in the response to find thename of the windows domain, and from that it can find the nameof the active directory server, and from that it can find thename of the user's mailbox. However, it's possible for thosesteps to go wrong, so the user has to be able to correct theresults / fill them in.So, wizard page one:    Windows username: ____________    Exchange server:  ____________    OWA path:         _/exchange/_    [X] Use Secure Password Authentication    [X] Remember my passwordpage two:    Exchange mailbox:              ________ (filled in with default)    Active Directory server:       ________  """"    [X] Limit number of responses: _500____++Also needs  [X] Show Public Folders++I'm currently playing with the idea of using CamelProviderConfEntry to""override"" some of the default labels/entries.It turns out that this is actually kinda nice, even if we decide thatthis isn't the right way to go to finish this bug off because itallows us to remove the evil if provider is mbox, then set the path to/var/spool/mail/fejj, or if it is maildir, then set it to $MAILDIR,else if it is ...that was kind of gross, now the provider can setup it's own defaultvalues for the Username, Hostname, and Path settings. It can also justoverride the label names if it wants (which is mostly added for thebenefit of Exchange).For example, you can now do:static CamelProviderConfEntry exchange_conf_entries[] = {        { CAMEL_PROVIDER_CONF_LABEL, ""username"", NULL,          N_(""Windows User_name:""), NULL },        { CAMEL_PROVIDER_CONF_LABEL, ""hostname"", NULL,          N_(""Exchange Server:""), NULL },        { CAMEL_PROVIDER_CONF_ENTRY, ""path"", NULL,          N_(""OWA _Path:""), ""/exchange"" },        { CAMEL_PROVIDER_CONF_CHECKBOX, ""spa"", NULL,          N_(""Use Secure Password Authentication""), ""0"" },        { CAMEL_PROVIDER_CONF_END }};Since ""username"", ""hostname"", and ""path"" are reserved config entrynames, the GUI can check for them and override the default widget stuff.(Note: for hostname and username, you can also use the ENTRY enum ifyou want to override the username/hostname values. Since this ismost-likely unneeded, I just used the LABEL enums)I didn't add the second page of CamelProviderConfEntry stuff, but youget the basic idea.Possible problems with this approach:1. the GUI code has to check for ""username"", ""hostname"" and ""path""ConfEntry's (although this isn't all that nasty...)2. will CamelProviderConfEntry work with any additions we may want tomake in later versions? If not, maybe we should look into danw's ideaof having the provider construct it's own GtkWidget pages.3. Can we do 2 pages without a gross hack usingCamelProviderConfigEntry's? How does it work for current Exchangeconfiguration?still need to consider how to allow the provider to get configcallbacks. The Exchange config UI needs to at least be notified ofwhen the user is about to go to page2 so that it can try andauto-detect the ""Exchange Mailbox"" and ""Active Directory Server"" settings.If the provider is going to remain ignorant of GtkWidgets, then weneed to have some way of giving it the values that the user has so farentered. We also need to make it so that it can return that it needsmore data (and which data it needs?) so that we can disallow the suerfrom going on to the next page until all the needed information isfilled in.Hmmm, the more I think about it the more I think that CamelProvidermight need to know about GtkWidgets and construct a form for us.++Created attachment 41181  [details]  [review] patch against connector/camel/camel-exchange-provider.c++danw just recently rpoposed a patch on gene-pool about making acheckbox for non-default OWA paths, so this patch might need someupdating to do that but otherwise should work.the only thing missing now is the implementation ofexchange_auto_detect_cb()updating to 20%-done, which assumes that the auto-detect code stillneeds to be implemented before this bug can be closed and also addingmore UI elements (if we need them?)++my work here is done.++why doe sbugzilla suck so bad?"

There are also several other places where %l is used when calling (eventually) strftime(). And in fact the function filter_date() in mail/message-list.c looks largely the same as ecd_get_text(), yet another case of lovely copy-paste coding habits.Most of the uses of the %l strftime format pass through e_utf8_strftime_fix_am_pm(), so it would be simplest to add Win32-specific code there that looks for %l and handles it appropriately: Change to %I, then afterwards check if the hour has a leading zero, and if so, change the zero to a blank.The exception is format_date_and_time_x() in plugins/itip-formatter/itip-view.c. On the other hand, that static function is always called with the third parameter use_24_hour_format TRUE, so the cases where it would try to use %l are never reached, d'oh.++Created attachment 62073  [details]  [review] Suggested patchOK to commit to HEAD and stable?++uhm... let's avoid the ""ok, we missed it, move it to the next milestone""-spam by just using a general ""2.6"" milestone and not a 2.6.1 one...++Oh well, no response, but as this is a change that affects Win32 only, went ahead and committed to HEAD and gnome-2-14."

""They show up but are minimally implemented to the point of being nearly useless in and of themselves.""  (i.e. they're still useful as-is w.r.t. the table as a whole because when we ask for the column header we get the column header, and they do have the expected associated Sort action.)If you go with the latter interpretation, bug 268473 caused this bug.

The oowriter test does not use assertions, therefore I figured I would update the test so that it does and then compare before and after the patch for this bug.  Unfortunately, when I run the oowriter test, after pressing Control+Home, using flat review to review the current line causes the menu bar to be reviewed rather than the first line of the document.  However, when I run the test manually (i.e. by performing the same steps), flat review begins on the first line as expected.  I cannot figure out what magical command or step to insert into the test to cause it to do ""the right thing"" (namely, starting from the top of the document rather than the top of the window). :-(  Any ideas?

When I'd finished dragging, I watched Evo do thethings it wanted to, and made sure there were no running operations left inthe statusbar.

481169,GStreamer,gstreamer (core),[tag] add support for geo tags (gps location etc.),"It would be nice to provide the ability of storing geotags inside multimedia files. Of course some research would be necessary about which data is stored and in what format.The documentation about how the EXIF standard does this can be found under http://www.exif.org/specifications.html (specification 2.2, page 52) or http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/TagNames/GPS.html++If we ever add new tags for that, they'd probably go into libgsttag in -base and not core.  Currently, I don't really see the point though, since we don't support EXIF tags yet (AFAIK), and that's probably the main use case.++Sorry for posting to core and not base, do not know the gstreamer internal structure that well.Actually, this idea is not intended to set EXIF tags, sorry for my unclear bug report. It is intended to store geotags in other file types like vorbis or speex. The EXIF specification is just there for information about how others store the tags.If I currently want to store geotags in an ogg/vorbis file, I can only store them inside the 'comment' field, but that means that the comment field is reserved for my geotags and cannot be used for anything else.Vorbis supports free-text tags, and I bet most other file formats do too, but I cannot set them using the TagSetter. That was the idea behind my feature request.++For vorbis/speex/flac you can use GST_TAG_EXTENDED_COMMENT which can contain key=value pairs and should be written as key=value into vorbis comments.++I think having the tags defined makes sense. Exif/xmp muxer/demuxer will come.If we use GST_TAG_EXTENDED_COMMENT, we cannot map the tags between different formats.++Yes, I agree with Stefan. In addition to EXIF and XMP that has some tags related to GPS, there might be some other formats or individual applications interested in GPS tags.Follow bellow my suggestion for those tags:GST_TAG_GPS_LATITUDE G_TYPE_STRING ""DDD,MM,SSk"" fixed size string where:  D- degrees, M- minutes, S-seconds, k- N (north) or S (south)GST_TAG_GPS_LONGITUDE ""DDD,MM,SSk"" fixed size string where:  D- degrees, M- minutes, S-seconds, k- E (east) or W (west)GST_TAG_GPS_ALTITUDE G_TYPE_FLOAT (negative mean bellow sea level)GST_TAG_GPS_SATELLITES G_TYPE_STRING (This tag can be used to describe  the number of satellites, their ID number, angle of elevation,  azimuth, SNR and other information in ASCII notation)GST_TAG_GPS_MEASUREMODE G_TYPE_INT (2 or 3 dimensional)GST_TAG_GPS_DOP G_TYPE_FLOAT (data degree of precision, HDOP for 2-dimensional,  PDOP for 3-dimensional)GST_TAG_GPS_SPEED G_TYPE_FLOAT (always in km/h)GST_TAG_GPS_TRACK G_TYPE_STRING ""xxx.xxkyyy.yy"" fixed size string where:  xxx.xx from 000.00 to 359.99  yyy.yy from 000.00 to 180.00 (vertical from down to up)  -01.00 for unknown direction  k - 'T' true direction  k - 'M' magnetic direction  This value means the direction of movement.GST_TAG_GPS_IMAGE_DIRECTION same type as GST_TAG_GPS_TRACK  this value means the direction of image (captured, or on user hands)GST_TAG_GPS_PROCESSINGMETHOD GST_TYPE_STRING (method used for location finding)GST_TAG_GPS_AREAINFORMATION GST_TYPE_STRING (name of the GPS area)GST_TAG_GPS_DIFFERENTIAL G_TYPE_BOOLEAN (if using measurement with differential  correction)I think those fields are good for the time being (I have proposed them by looking at Exif and XMP, except for vertical direction with was by myself).BR,Edgard++In addition, for SPEED we could have a char to say Horizontal, Vertical or vecTorial.++I think longitude and latitude should also be floats (ie. WGS84 decimal degrees, which is what's most useful and most easy to process in practice). Do we really need all of this stuff, is it really that useful?++I belive GST_TAG_GPS_LATITUDE, GST_TAG_GPS_LONGITUDE, GST_TAG_GPS_ALTITUDE would be enough. They need to be defined, as the raw numbers can be interpreted in different ways. I'll cook up a proposal.++double, please.  Latitude/logitude expressed as float has a resolution of 19 meters.++Okay, so what about GST_TAG_GPS_LATITUDE, GST_TAG_GPS_LONGITUDE, GST_TAG_GPS_ALTITUDE as doublesGST_TAG_GPS_LATITUDE: degrees, negative values for southern latitudesGST_TAG_GPS_LONGITUDE: degrees, negative values for western longitudesGST_TAG_GPS_ALTITUD: meters, zero is sea levelThat matches what 3gp/mp4 does. Its also sufficient for EXIF [1][2][1] http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/TagNames/GPS.html [2] http://www.exif.org/Exif2-2.PDF Instead of GST_TAG_GPS_AREAINFORMATION we could have GST_TAG_GPS_LOCATION (see Bug #548652 ). I would be fine with assuming that we talk about Earth locations always for now.++Created attachment 117450  [details]  [review] add geo location tagsI named the tags slighly different.

Thanks. I don't think we can. The reason we serialize the message to data *before* this is to be able to return errors at message submission time (e.g. in another thread).If we were to do this we would need to somehow check that a message has been altered between running filters and after (g_dbus_message_get_last_change() etc.) and that leads to a lot of overhead/complexity.As a work-around, just consume the message (returning TRUE in the handler) and then submit the message again using g_dbus_connection_send_message().++How about call the filter in the default main loop thread for outgoing message(in g_dbus_connection_send_lock function)?

108711,gnome-terminal,general,Encoding might be part of the profile,"I think it would be nice if a profile would also record the encoding to beused. I usually work both in UTF8 and latin-1, and it's a bit annoying tohave to set the encoding each time, since I do use different profiles(different bg colors, so I can tell them apart)If this does not seem right, then adding the /Terminal/Character Encodingmenu item to the right button context menu would be nice, since right nowto change the encoding I have to show the menu bar, do the change, and hidethe menubar again.Cheers,-- m++A good idea I think, may be a duplicate bug.A workaround in short-term is to set $LANG when you run the terminal (you have to use --disable-factory to do this so each terminal is its own process). The terminal defaults to the encoding from there.so e.g. LANG=es.UTF-8 etc.++A patch follows which will add the encoding to profiles (the commenton top of terminal-profile.c is very pertinent!)It does add a field on the `General' page of the profile editor.This introduces an interaction with the menu ""/Terminal/Characterencoding"": If a profile wants encoding A, and you open a screen withthat profile, then change the encoding to B manually, and then editthe profile so that it calls for encoding C, your screen will have itsencoding set to C; probably not what the user would have in mind. This might be solved by adding an encoding_follows_profile flag onscreens, which is set to false when the encoding is changed manually(and probably a ""Use encoding from profile"" (probably with betterwording) option in the ""/Terminal/Character encoding"" submenu, so thata screen can be made to start following the profile after a manualprofile change)++Created attachment 15779  [details]  [review] Patch to add encoding to profiles++Bug 103275 should be marked as a dup of this.++*** Bug 103275 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++Applied patch and looked at it more now -I don't think there's really room on the General tab; what I've been saying for most preference addition bugs is that we need to mark all such bugs with the ""pref"" keyword, then list requested and current prefs in priority order, then draw a line and only include those above the line; we have limited space available.I'm fairly sure encoding would be above the line, so I'm willing to cut corners on doing the full big-picture analysis, but it still doesn't fit on the general tab.The Compatibility tab may well be right. All non-Unicode encodings are basically deprecated and broken for terminals, and only UTF-8 is really used on UNIX variants, so UTF-8 is pretty much the only right thing to use except for back compat.On another UI note, I think a button Add or Remove... as in the Character Coding submenu is necessary in the profile dialog as well, or it will be too confusing when people see only ""Use locale"" available. This also means dynamically updating the option menu in the profile dialog when profiles are added/removed.I would also say ""Current Locale"" instead of ""Use Locale"" (to match the wording of the character coding menu)++Created attachment 15883  [details]  [review] Patch synced to HEAD (glade patch didn't apply)++Is this pending an updated patch from the reporter?++Yes, I reviewed this yesterday++*** Bug 116946 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 111309 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 131756 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 128040 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++128040, which I just marked as a dup of this, is really a patch to addan --encoding option to the command line, but close enough.++*** Bug 146422 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 157276 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 165973 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 303453 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++I noticed that this long-standing thing still is not ingnome-terminal 2.10, but Havoc states above that the patchhas been applied.

Basically, I wonder if this really belongsin the profiles at all if that patch is applied.Never mind this comment if it's decided that 313480 is a WONTFIX (though I mostcertainly hope it's not ;) or if some other use case is in mind (it's a smalloperation to remove the encoding combo box from the server editor dialog).++For example, bug 313650 explicitly asks for this to be added because of someservers running with different encoding. It's also why I personally addedEncoding as a per server setting. Having to change this _every_ time you connectis _very_ annoying.Also, having this in profiles would make it less obvious how to set a differentencoding for a server.Sadly, UTF-8 hasn't achieved world domination quite yet. :)++I actually use different encodings locally. I do a lot of work on files invarious encodings over network filesystems (afs, nfs,...) and it would make mylife a lot easier if the encoding was part of the profile instead of per server. IMHO it is more obvious to put the encoding in the profile and select a profilewith the correct encoding in the server edit dialog, instead of selecting both aprofile and an encoding.++Selecting a different encoding from ""Terminal->Select Character Encoding"" isn'tharder than selecting a different profile in ""Terminal->Profile"" with adifferent encoding. In fact, it's even more work since you have to create andmaintain a separate profile for every single encoding you want to use.But yes, having encoding specific profiles in ""File->Open Terminal"" and""File->Open Tab"" gives you a faster way to open a new terminal with a specificencoding. It's still extra work to create and maintain the different encodingsthough.Perhaps entries named ""<Profile> <Encoding>"" can be created automatically forevery encoding you've added to the Encoding menu that's not the current locale?(Just an idea, but I don't think I like it.)On the other hand...* Why should encoding be different from any other preference?* Older encodings are being deprecated in favor of UTF-8, so maybe having it inprofiles and adding some extra maintenance work for people persisting on usingthem ain't that big of a deal.++I can't specify an encoding when starting a terminal from command-line or byputting an application launcher on the desktop or in the panel, but I canspecify a profil. f I want a different encoding than the default I _have_ toswitch it manually using the menu for every terminal/tab.As you say why should the encoding be different from other preferences? And asHavoc suggests the right place to put it is probably in the Compability tab.++Btw, I think --encoding is a good idea irrespective of whether encoding is addedto profiles or not.++*** Bug 313650 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++In response to comment #28 , yes you can. It's a bit awkward butcan be done, just as outlined in Havoc's first comment here. Createa script like e.g. this:#!/bin/shexport LANG=sv_SEgnome-terminal --disable-factory --command=""ssh foo@bar.com "" --title=FooThen call that script (full path!) from your launcher.

I think that an --encoding switch would be far more elegant - and a proposed patch was on the web, and above in comment # 35 .It would be nice if new tabs would ""copy"" the current encoding from the active tab  or if the profile could set the encoding.

There's not even a screen blip to say it's been successful.Steps to reproduce the problem:1. Choose Mail2. Highlight Piece of Text You Want To Copy3. Open New Message4. Click Paste.. and Nothing Happens.Actual Results:no pasted dataExpected Results:pasted dataHow often does this happen?

Sure, X-style copy-paste with the mouse works great but Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V definitely does not.  It also does not work from an actual message view window.  If you like I will re-file it or you can just change the summary or whatever.I know I reported this on the mailing list, I guess I didn't file a bug about it, though.  Ooops.++fejj: you be the judge of this one; I'm not sure if Ctl-C/Ctl-V areintended to work with the standard X cut'n'paste or not.++Waitasec!  I didn't mean to imply that the two clipboards should be cross-pasteable (though as someone who got used to clipboards on windoze, it does seem odd to have two clipboards).  I just think they should each both work all the time, in their own ways. I don't expect to be able to copy something with Ctrl-C and then paste it with middle-click.* X-style copy-n-paste should ALWAYS work.* Win?-style copy-n-paste should ALWAYS work, if you're going to implement it at all (and please do-I hate having to use pointing devices).++no matter how I try to copy/paste from the preview to an xterm, italways works. Whether I use Copy and Paste or Copy and middle click,or highlight and Paste...it always works for me.++Um, I'm not sure why you keep talking pasting to an xterm, but I'm really puzzled what you mean by it works both ways.  Does Ctrl-V work for paste in an xterm?  I know middle-click does... but I stopped using xterm a while ago and now use gnome-terminal.  It definitely does not support Ctrl-V or anything but mid-click for paste.But in any case what we need at the very least is to have is the ability to copy and paste _from_ Evo _to_ Evo.  All I want to do is to be able to copy text from the preview pane (or view window) and paste it into a new message, using the key combinations of Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V.  It's supported in other parts of Evo, and they're listed in the Edit menu as shortcuts.AFAICT, Copy/Cut and Paste (in the Edit menu) do absolutely nothing from the main evolution window, but I could be wrong.  Copy and paste messages from folder to folder?  That doesn't seem to work...++Actually I think the bug is still there. After copying some text fromthe preview pane or the message view window, you cannot paste it backin another area of evolution like compose window (body and address).But if you open xterm, and choose edit/paste, it is OK. As for Mozillathe menu doesn't even enable paste and ctrl-v doesn't do anything.HTHPascal++*** bug 211049 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++The Mozilla issue might be a Mozilla bug then.

68287,galeon,User interface,Cookie controls in Settings menu?,"I personally am a big fan of the methods proposed in bug reports 60118 and67570. Since these are Mozilla (not Galeon) problems, however, I have beenforced to take an alternative approach to automatically stop unwantedcookies from entering my system. Normally I have my cookie settings on""Accept from current server only"" and ""Warn before accepting a cookie"".When I encounter sites that barrage me with cookies (and hence forcing meto click ""no"" to each and every cookie), I temporarily change this to""Never accept"".To make this easier, I propose that the cookie controls be directlyaccessible from the Settings menu, just as the Javascript and proxysettings (via a submenu) are now. The Settings menu is a major strength ofGaleon, and it should be exploited to its utmost potential.++This would add too much stuff to an already crufted menu. The cookieeditor is a tool and should be in the tool menu. Also accessing thesame dialog from two different menus would be really ugly.++I'm sorry, but I think you may have misunderstood me (probably myfault :).I didn't want a link to the actual cookie editor on the Settings menu,only the cookie settings (of which there are only four). The cookieeditor can already be accessed from the Tools menu. The 'image sites'editor can also be accessed from the Tools menu, yet image controlsstill exist under Settings. Why not cookies, then?My proposal is to have a 'Cookies' submenu of the Settings menu, justas 'Load images', 'Animate images' and 'Proxy' are now. In otherwords, there will only be one extra entry (Cookies) visible from theSettings menu. In this Cookies submenu, there would be radio buttonsfor 'Always accept', 'Accept from current server only' and 'Neveraccept'. Optionally, there can be a checkbox for 'Warn beforeaccepting a cookie'.Alternatively, these options can be added to the Cookies submenu ofthe Tools menu, but I think it best to place it in the Settings menu.I am sorry to pester you after you have made your decision, but itseems to me that cookie control (i.e. security and privacy) is a highpriority for *nix users. Mozilla offers only rudimentary controls. Myproposal, I believe, is a good workaround for this. It can be easilyremoved when Mozilla gains some decent controls itself (a la Konquerorand Opera).++*** Bug 72748 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++This is implemented in galeon 1.3"

To be specific:1. add something likehardstatus alwayslastline ""%n (%t) %= (%l)   %D %M %d  %C %a""to .screenrc, which puts a statusbar at the bottom of the screen.  This is aline with the current time, etc. which does not scroll and should always befixed at the bottom line of the terminal (only the rest of the terminal scrolls).2. start gnome-terminal and turn off menu bar3. run GNU screen and press return until the prompt is at the bottom of the screen.4. turn on menu bar and then turn it back off5. cat a file with lines longer than width of windowThe screen status bar should not scroll but it does.++Err, isn't this screen's fault?

649165,pygobject,introspection,Enumeration symbols are LC_CTYPE specific,"We recently got a bug report about PyGI programs failing in Turkish locales ( https://launchpad.net/bugs/747796 ). Under tr_TR.UTF-8, exported symbols with an uppercase ""I"" come out as lowercase ""i':$ python -c ""import locale; from gi.repository import Gtk; locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'tr_TR.UTF-8'); print dir(Gtk.IconSize)""['BUTTON', 'DND', 'DiALOG', 'iNVALiD', ...]It is correct in C and e. g. de_DE.UTF-8: PYTHONPATH=. python -c ""import locale; from gi.repository import Gtk; locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'de_DE.UTF-8'); print dir(Gtk.IconSize)""['BUTTON', 'DIALOG', 'DND', 'INVALID', ...]In tr_TR.UTF-8, you get an AttributeError when you try to access e. g. Gtk.IconSize.DIALOG.It has been demonstrated that this can be worked around by enclosing a GI call into a pair of locale.setlocale(locale.LC_CTYPE, 'C') / locale.setlocale(locale.LC_CTYPE, '') calls. In other words, the initial ""from gi.repository import Gtk"" import worked correctly, but the bug seems to happen for (un)marshalling the symbol names. At the symbol marshalling time there should not happen any LC_CTYPE conversion? Or do we need to consider programming languages which actually support non-ASCII identifiers?++A simple reproducer is to run ""LANG=tr_TR.UTF-8 make check"". This will fail in both test_gi and test_gdbus, due to this problem.Interestingly, calling ""LANG=tr_TR.UTF-8 TEST_NAMES=test_gi make check"" does NOT fail, neither does TEST_NAMES=test_gdbus. It seems that running some other test (like the Gtk ones?) ""clutters"" the marshalling in some way.++For the record, Turkish locales map two ASCII characters to non-ASCII characters with respect to case conversion:    ""I"" (capital I) is mapped to ""ı"" (lowercase i-dotless)    ""i"" (lowercase i) is mapped to ""İ"" (capital I-dotted)This seems to be related, and it has been demonstrated that hacking the tr_TR locale definition for ""toupper"" and ""tolower"" to map i -> I and I->i also fixes the problem.Indeed there is a case conversion going on here with enumeration values. E. g. if the gir specifies     <enumeration name=""IconSize""[...]      <member name=""invalid""then this is accessed in python as ""INVALID"".I think gi/module.py IntrospectionModule.__getattr__() does this conversion. If I add some debugging to the ""for value_info in info.get_values():"" loop, I get:  IntrospectionModule __getattr_(IconSize): upping dialog  == DiALOGImporting Gtk somehow triggers a setlocale(), which explains why the gdbus and gi tests work when being called on their own, but fail under tr_TR.UTF-8 when test_overrides also run:$ python -c 'import locale; print locale.getlocale(); from gi.repository import Gtk; print locale.getlocale();'(None, None)('de_DE', 'UTF8')So I think I have found the root cause here.The question is now whether we should really use a locale specific upper() call here, or just switch to the C locale for this? I think we should do the latter. locale-specific constant names do sound a bit crazy to me.++This patch fixes it:--- a/gi/module.py+++ b/gi/module.py@@ -24,6 +24,7 @@ from __future__ import absolute_import import os import gobject+import locale import gi from .overrides import registry@@ -121,7 +122,13 @@ class IntrospectionModule(object):                 wrapper.__module__ = 'gi.repository.' + info.get_namespace()                 for value_info in info.get_values():+                    # switch to C locale for upper() to avoid locale specific+                    # identifier conversion (e. g. in Turkish 'i'.upper() == 'i')+                    # see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=649165 +                    old_ctype = locale.getlocale(locale.LC_CTYPE)+                    locale.setlocale(locale.LC_CTYPE, 'C')                     value_name = value_info.get_name().upper()+                    locale.setlocale(locale.LC_CTYPE, old_ctype)                     setattr(wrapper, value_name, wrapper(value_info.get_value()))I'm now working on a proper test case, and then submit a complete git-formatted patch as an attachment.++Created attachment 187038  [details]  [review] proposed patchProposed patch, including test suite integration.Unfortunately the standard Python library does not have an ASCII only variant of upper(). gi.repository.GLib provides g_ascii_toupper(), but this only works on a single char, and I'm not sure whether it's a good idea to use this in gi/module.py (feels so recursive). Also, performance-wise it would be a lot worse, I suppose.++A few comments.  First str.upper() is defined to be locale-dependent for 8-bit strings.  I don't know what that implies for unicode strings.  Second, I agree that locale-dependent identifiers is crazy talk :).I think I'd actually implement the temporary switch in locales as a context manager so that 1) it works for the with-statement; 2) you can't accidentally *not* reset the locale should some exception occur during the work.  E.g. (mostly untested):import localefrom contextlib import contextmanager@contextmanagerdef c_locale():    old_ctype = locale.getlocale(locale.LC_CTYPE)    locale.setlocale(locale.LC_CTYPE, 'C')    try:        yield    finally:        locale.setlocale(locale.LC_CTYPE, old_ctype)with c_locale():    for value_info in info.get_values():        value_name = value_info.get_name().upper()        setattr(wrapper, value_name, wrapper(value_info.get_value()))If you don't like the call syntax in the with statement, you could instead create a class with __enter__() and __exit__() methods, then instantiate that class globally so everyone has access to it.++Created attachment 187099  [details]  [review] proposed patchThanks Barry for your review.

Maybe there is something in the gstreamer mechanic that is causing               this buffer leakFrom briefly lloking at it, it indeed looks suspicious. http://webcvs.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-base/gst/videorate/gstvideorate.c?view=markup gst_video_rate_flush_prev() is called several time, but only in one place (chain()) the return value is checked. Maybe gst_video_rate_flush_prev() should unref the buffer if its not pushing it (eos_before_buffers), so that it like pad_push() takes ownership.++I have had a look at videorate and I can not find a leak (nor do the tests at the moment).  Specifically, gst_video_rate_flush_prev cannot create a leak, as it only adds 1 ref to a cached buffer and then gives away this ref to a _pad_push (whatever that one's outcome may be).  It is indeed called in a few places without checking the return value, as it would have little value in those other cases (event handling), nor is there anything being leaked by not checking the return value in those event cases.  _flush_prev need not take ownership (of the cached buffer), since it is always replaced using _swap_prev, which does not leak the previous one (and the state_change in any case cleans the cache).Regarding the IRC fragment:* a pad_push always takes ownership (regardless of outcome), but note that it is not the _chain's buffer (as an input parameter) that has been pushed, but a previously cached buffer (or rather, an extra created ref to that cached buffer), as all done in _flush_prev (the extra ref it creates is taken over by the peer as a result of the _pad_push it performs, regardless of that result)* similarly, _videorate_chain must take ownership of its input buffer, whether it succeeds or fails.  Roughly, if it succeeds, the incoming buffer's ref is retained as the buffer is put into the cache (by using _swap_prev), or the incoming buffer is simply dropped (gst_buffer_unref) in case of some failure.As far as I can tell, all _chain's code paths do either one of these, so the input buffer can then not be leaked.(and the original fix added a missing _unref to one of the failure paths)Please indicate the suspected leak in more detail (or re-close this bug).++It is me who sent the IRC comment : You are indeed correct with the description and the leak I was chasing turn out to be elsewhere in my own code... So you may close this issue. Sorry about the confusion."

Since the applet is an out of process applet, on a button press the applet grabs the pointer. So in the panel when we try to grab the pointer XGrabPointer() call fails with return code AlreadyGrabbed. I am attaching a patch which does the following.In bonobo-plug.c, where we forward the button press/release events (bonobo_plug_button_press), if ungrab_pointer flag (which has been added) is set then after the XSendEvent() XUngrabPointer() is called. This fixes the problem. An alternative could be that before we call gdk_pointer_grab() in panel-widget.c we check if the applet to be dragged is an out of process applet. If so we traverse down to the bonobo-socket which in turn sends a message to the bonobo-plug to ungrab the pointer the applet has grabbed. This approach may be cleaner because the ungrabbing the pointer by the applet is a requirement of the panel and not for the applets as such. However the patch i have uploaded would not cause any problem. If an app which contains the applets doesnt really require the ungrabbing feature a method can be added which sets the flag. Ofcourse if the flag is not needed and forward_events flags should suffice then the flag itself may be removed.++Created attachment 7244  [details]  [review] Proposed patch++The patch also fixes bug #74017++Shivram: please make sure to update the keywords in the future :)++*** Bug 74017 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 76623 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++Shivram: thanks for looking into this.

432661,pitivi,Media library,Properly cache and generate thumbnails for the media library,"We should cache the generated thumbnails, possibly using the freedesktop.org specs.++This is why thumbnails are not shown when I load a saved project, I presume. Or should I file a separate issue about that?++Yes and No. It would solve the issue on standard systems (respecting the fdo specs), but we would still need to also store them in the project files/directories (so we can move the thumbnails along with the project).++My understanding would rather be:1) if there is no thumbnail, create it according to fdo (so nautilus and such benefit from it; and, inversely, you can get thumbnails for free from nautilus' thumbnailer/fdo-compliant apps)2) if the project (.pptv) moves, thumbnails are unaffected since they come from the system anyway; the thumbnail is not stored with the project per se3 if the .pptv is moved onto an altogether different computer, goto 14 if the media files moved, goto 15 if the thumbnails disappeared, goto 1I think thumbnails are not important enough to be moved along with the project. They can be generated on demand on the working system, no?++That logic makes sense... except for one little thing ... You're not guaranteed that, if you move the project to another computer, that person has the plugins needed to decode/playback/support all the files.If we move the thumbnails with the project then for the unsupported files we could:* still show the sources used in the sources browser along with its metadata and thumbmail,* still show in the timeline the sources using that file and instead of using the fully-decoded audio/video we could show a continuous video stream using that thumbnail (along with maybe a ""missing file overlay"").This is something we want to have supported in the new design and is already supported in some pro editors as well as in AAF for example.++I'm not sure to understand the usefulness of showing thumbnails for a clip that the user can't playback because of lack of plugins or because the file is 404; I was thinking that, on the contrary, missing thumbnails might be a very obvious visual ""indicator"" to the user raise awareness of the problem? But I guess I see what you want to achieve. It might be more complicated for not much though, just a thought.++Regarding the freedesktop thumbnailing specification, it's dead and is implemented only by nautilus afaik. Besides, it's only for one-thumbnail-per-file cases. We can generate hundreds of thumbnails for the same file so i don't think it applies to pitivi.++Alessandro, argh.. that's bad :(Aren't there any new specs for where to store thumbnails ? Or does every app do his own stuff ?++pvanhoof wrote something on his blog when he was working on the thumbnailer for hildon, but i don't think that a spec came out of that.++http://live.gnome.org/ThumbnailerSpec seems to be about pvanhoof's work, seems to be edited often.++I finally have a fix for this is my ""thumbnails-from-fdo"" branch. It simply gets the thumbnails from the fdo thumbnails dir and does no thumbnail generation. From my understanding, it would make more sense for gst discoverer should be the one to do thumbnail generation (or totem's code to be upstreamed to gst).++Keep it open because of thumbnails generation. We should open a new bug about that in GStreamer for the discoverer to handle the thumbnail generation and make this one depend on the GStreamer one.author Jean-François Fortin Tam < nekohayo@gmail.com > Fri, 30 Dec 2011 18:00:55 +0000 (13:00 -0500)commit892319e0112add23881334cef2b196807ef78370++This task is open for anyone willing to attempt finishing it, so adding the gnome-love keyword.++Pitivi can use the gnome-desktop API to generate thumbnails. This is what nautilus uses internally. Note that the API is synchronous, we probably don't want to wait for the thumbnail before adding them to the media library. Nautilus has a worker thread and a queue, it updates the UI when the thumbnail is ready.About the unsupported format, my personal opinion is that the discoverer should tell us if a file is not supported on the current system. UI whise I would put a specific icon to represent that. We could then consider a UI similar to what Totem is doing for missing plugins.Currently, the gnome-desktop API uses the thumbnailers specified by desktop files in /usr/share/thumbnailers/. It contains on my side the Totem and Evince thumbnailer. I feel like we could provide a thumbnailer in GStreamer (which would deprecate the totem one). This way PiTiVi would not depend on Totem for that. But that is just an idea.Obviously, for timeline thumbnails, we have no choice but to implement our own. This makes using gnome-desktop API a little redundant. If we where to have a gstreamer thumbnailer, we could depend on that to generate both the file thumbnail, and the one for the timeline. Those thumbnails seems very specific to PiTiVi, but not specific to a project, so I'd store them in .cache/pitivi/thumbnails imho. Generating them out of process is probably a good idea.++Got a bit sick of waiting for this to happen in gst discoverer bug #667203 , so I did it in Pitivi for now. If 667203 finally happens, we'll need to open a new Pitivi bug.commit 75c01e5f0d353092ab31488ca0d1d6c629ff2041 Author: Alexandru Băluț < alexandru.balut@gmail.com >Date:   Fri Jan 3 17:45:17 2014 +0100    medialibrary: Generate thumbnails in the backgroundcommit bf95c041c774eacc877b94fb2e6a3d18c2436868 Author: Jean-François Fortin Tam < nekohayo@gmail.com >Date:   Mon Dec 16 20:53:24 2013 -0500    medialibrary: Automatically generate missing thumbnails        Completes the solution for bug #432661"

137864,vte,general,gnome-terminal soaks up tons of CPU time,"I just built mozilla in a gnome-terminal that I promptly minimized. Whenthe build finished, gnome-terminal had used more than 10 *minutes* of CPUtime. This was a substantial fraction of the total build time! (I was usinga fairly snappy Itanium 2 system)Where is this time being spent? I can understand that managing a scrollbackbuffer would take _some_ effort (indeed, gnome-terminal also reported a VMsize of 64MB, 36MB RSS), but is it time to replace a linked list withsomething a bit more sane? Or at least to have a better think about logmanagement? Perhaps maintaining an approximate (as opposed toline-accurate) size scrollback buffer could help things.Other than scrollback, I've no idea what a minimized terminal could bedoing to soak up CPU time like that.++One thing to note here is that all terminals are sharing the same process...That said, it is true that we need to work on speed. Help with profiling vtewould be very appreciated...++Created attachment 26446  [details] a profile of a minimized gnome-terminal scrolling lots of text++Here's a profile for you!To generate this profile, I just ran hexdump -C <large AVI movie file> inside agnome-terminal, which I immediately minimized (i.e. for 99.9% of the time, therewas no window at all, just an entry in the gnome panel). The highlights seem to be: _vte_table_match (10% of total time)_vte_draw_set_scroll (5%)_vte_buffer_length (3%)gdk_pixbuf_scale (15%)pixops_scale (7%)g_array_append_vals (4%)g_tree_search (8%)    I'm just guessing here, but looking at some of these names, perhaps it'stime to get the hash table shotgun out 8)++Created attachment 26447  [details] a profile of a visible gnome-terminal scrolling lots of text++OK, here's another profile: the same test (long hexdump (several minutes), ^C,exit), but this time with the gnome-terminal visible (80x25, no huge fonts oranything).Interestingly, _vte_table_match remains at 10%, g_array_append_vals is still 4%and g_tree_search is still 8% but there are some new heavy hitters:_vte_draw_fill_rectangle (5%)_vte_buffer_clear (3%)gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data (22% !)One thing I noticed upon starting the hexdump is that for a few thousand linesit seemed to run very quickly, but after that it slowed down to something like a90% duty cycle, i.e. 10% of the time the terminal would just sit there, notscrolling. About once a second or so, these 0.1s pauses would show up, but onlyafter a few thousand lines had scrolled past smoothly.

The same amount of scrollback is being used in each case.These terminals are basically doing the same thing. About the only visibledifference is that the gnome-terminal scrollbar has a ""jellybean"" widget whereasrxvt has a simpler 2D scrollbar.

If you send patches here, I'll do my best to try and updatethe profile information.++Hi, I am the author of rxvt-unicode, and have some comments.First of all @Gabor Farkas: of course rxvt-unicode has a menu. There is noexcuse for people sprreading FUD that could easily be clarified by reading rthemanual page *g*.Xft fonts are slow, but that is not the problem of gnome-terminal, as xterm(Also slow) and rxvt-unicode (much slower than non-xft) are much afster. So muchis already clear from reading this bug-report.gnome-terminal uses pango, and I hear that this is required for correct i18n. Ijust installed gnome-terminal 2.6.1-4 (debian), and found that, whilegnome-terminal uses pango, the font drawing is much worse than rxvt-unicode:arabic is broken, characters run into each other.Pango is *extremely* slow (orders of magnitude slower than using x core fonts oreven directly using xft fonts), but what you get from using pango is correctrendeing of realyl complex scripts (arabic for example). In gnome-terminal, itseems as if pango slows down gnome-terminal with no additional benefit.Redrawing the scrollbar should not be a bottleneck in gnome-temrinal, as rxvtredraws the scrollbar completely, unptimised, on every scroll.Also, using blitting on scrolls and waiting for expose events (as suggested) isslowing down redrawing immensely, and is only of help on slow links (blitz ==less data over the link).In almost all cases it is much faster to just re-draw the screen on changes.Don'T create expose events by using any kind of optimized scroll, that might bea bit better for cpu time, but slows down redrawing because it needsserver-turnarounds.For example, strace rxvt and gnome-terminal: when scorlling, rxvt does not readfrom the server, it just sends data to the server: no server timearound. (theeffect can bets be seen if you emnable blinking and use blinking tetx. usuallyrxvt-unicode's strace will look likeselect/timeout/gettimeofday/write/write/select/timeout etc.Also, double-buffering is very slow. Try turning of double-buffering in thedisplay widget. If it now flickers, you have a problem. xterm flickers a lot onredraws, rxvt less and rxvt-unicode almost none as it draws the background whileredraing characters (useing XDrawImageString if possible, or clearing justbefore drawing in other cases).I just improved rxvt-unicode's scrolling speed a lot, and I am seeing similarproblems to xterm and gnome-terminal which I tried to solve. First of all, amajor point of slowdown (ignoring actual drawing of the characters) is not doingjump-scrolling. I am not sure wether gnome-terminal does jump-scroling, itdoesn't look that way to me.Some terminals (eterm for example) cheat a lot by only showing 1/5th of thetext, i.e. only drawing every firth full-screen when scorling hard. rxvt-unicodealso dowsa this, but only for every second screen. You can edit command.hREFRESH_PERIODS to adjuts this value for tests. I think xterm cheats even more,but I think it's important to show almost all the text, so I don't thinkomitting output excessively is a good idea.A common problem (as testified in other gnome-terminal bug-reports) is schedulerinteraction. The original rxvt dfoes not realyl suffer from this, as it uses atight inenr loop, while rxvt-unicode and gnome-temrinal use an event system,which makes these things mroe difficult (Difefrent priorities for different filehandles for example).Terminal output is often line-by-line: redrawing after eahc tty-read istherefore going to be dog-slow. Newer linux kernels can buffer up to 4095 (sic!)characters, but that's not universal, and might help terminals.rxvt-unicode has two modes of scrolling: normal mode, where refreshes aredelayed by 0.01 seconds (i.e. it will only update the screen 0.01s aftere thelast change, wqhich is always early enough), and hard-scrolling, which istriggered automatically when there is more output than fits on one screen.The latter ensures that redraws are done more often when lots of tetx scrollsby. Also, only showing every second screen is only done when the amount of dataoverwhelms rxvt, on normal output (typicall ls output) it will still show everyscreen.In any case, redrawing immediately after receiving data is a no-no.Also, resources: urxvtd with 10 open terminals (no scrolling done yet) uses 6MBof memory (2MB rss), while a single gnome-terminal already uses 40MB memory(15MB RSS). cpu caching is a major concern in modern machins, and it's possiblethat the sheer amountof code run in gnome-terminal causes a lot of cache-missesthat smaller terminals don't have. This does not apply to konsole as much, whichis also big (but way smaller than gnome-terminal still :)Last not leats: the scrollback buffer. I use large scrollback buffer s(manythousands of lines). original rxvt uses a for-loop to shuffle the line pointersaround in memory. replacing that by a memmove gave me (GNU/Linux-x86) a 5%increase in scrolling speed. I wil be able to reduce this further.Other data structures (lists etc.) are bound to be slower, though, due tocache-effects and the sheer slowness of acecssing them.Please note that rxvt-unicode also uses jump-scrolling _internally_, i.e. it canadd a screenful of lines without doing any scorlling internally). As copyingcharacters from the tty to internal buffers is using a non-trivial amount oftime (using mbtowc is already a major-time-burner!) this saves a LOT of time.... I think I forgot a few minor points, but the above might be helpful foranybody trying to improve gnome-terminal... I must honestly admit thatgnome-terminal really *is* slow, even for it's features... :)++Sorry fot the additional comment, and sorry for the many typoes (a textarea isnot a nice place to edit large amounts of text :).I just did some experiments with konsole, which seems to ahve become very muchfaster (it's almost as fats as rxvt-unicode, sometiems even fatser). However, Inoticed that it only redraws the screen about 7 times per second (see thesection about terminals cheating in my last comment). When this is switched off,konsole isn't that much faster anymore than gnome-terminal.I am thinking about making this a prefernces option in rxvt-unicode: some peopledon't really want all tetx on screen screen, others (like me) want that,a sanalysing afst output streams (e.g. tcpdump) is still possible even when youcan'T read the text scrolling by (the human visual system is amazing :).Aggressively mitigating and delaying scrolls by 0.1s or more might be a majorspeed increase, at least profilign data suddenly becomes more valid. If this isa prefernces item than most of the problems (related to redraw time, there mightbe others) are gone, at the same cost as konsole, and I don't see many peopelcomplaining.++Created attachment 30710  [details]  [review] walk the string ourselves instead of using memchr 6+ timesFirst optimization:There's a function that tries to find the first control character in a string.The current code walks that string using memchr for every control characterresulting in 6+ iterations over the string.This patch optimizes it and walks the string only once.++Benjamin: Note that your patch is already included as part of the patch in bug143914 (submitted a couple months ago).  Also note that there are variouspatches in bug 122656 (some up to a year old, although some may be solarisspecific).

Currentlythe adjustment's values are absolute, that means the maximum value is thenumber of lines ever added inside the terminal. So when you add a new line tothe terminal (by pressing return for example), the last line from the historygets deleted, but  the asjustment gets updated: Upper bound, lower bound andcurrent value all get incremented by one. This causes gnome-terminal to updatethe slider.This patch makes the adjustment always number the oldest line in the history -and therefore the lower bound of the adjustment - as 0. The upper bound istherefore only limited by the visible area and the number of scrollback linesand doesn't get changed when lines get inserted.This results in the slider not being updated. hexdumping or cat'ing a big file is up to 50% faster with this patch.++Elijah: yeah, someone should apply those patches at some point or assemble allperformance improvements in one bug report it seems :)The last 3 patches are new though. And the first one was obvious anyway. ;)FWIW, with all these patches applied cat'ing a ~1MB file in a fullscreenterminal (150x40 I think) now takes 14 instead of 43 seconds, in a 80x25terminal it takes 7 instead of 23 seconds.++Created attachment 30798  [details]  [review] second try with not updating the sliderThe last patch was quite a bit broken, this one is supposed to be better.++Thanks for that - I had tried your previous patch set, but the scrolling wasindeed very broken. I'll try again soon (sometime today), and get back withperformance figures.++Benjamin, bad news :(  Here are my timings:baseline (gnome-terminal 2.7.3, vte 0.11.11): 65 (+/-5) seconds (some fixedhexdump output)applying only the slider patch: 80 secondsapplying all the patches except the custom GTree: 74 secondsapplying all the patches: 77 secondsSo I wonder, what is your system like? Which theme are you using? What does'x11perf -aaftext' report for your system? (I get 1,230,000 chars/sec, or inother words, just drawing the glyphs for this test should take around 7.5 seconds)++Duraid: Could you post what timings you obtain with the patches in bug 143914 and maybe also bug 122656 ?++OK, I just tested the patch in bug 143914 . This patch seems to be a win. In anattempt to get something like a fair comparison, I altered VTE_COALESCE_TIMEOUTand VTE_DISPLAY_TIMEOUT to both be 2.The benchmark then completed in 51.8 seconds, not 65 as before. Nevertheless, itdid still seem as if less text was being rendered but that could just be mymemory playing tricks on me. It's also worth bearing in mind that the ""optimal""time for this test (i.e. if gnome-terminal and vte both use zero CPU time) isstill around 10 seconds, not zero. So the improvement is significant: a 25%boost or so.However, the real win comes when setting VTE_COALESCE_TIMEOUT andVTE_DISPLAY_TIMEOUT to larger values. e.g. using values of 3 and 5 respectively,the benchmark finishes in 23 seconds, but appears to be scrolling at the samerate as with 2/2. Nevertheless, there are still usability issues, even withthese small values. If I maximize gnome-terminal and 'ls -la' my messy homedirectory (around 1000 files+), it finishes quickly enough but the variance inwhat I see between runs is huge, and if it wasn't for the fact that I alreadyknow what's in there, I wouldn't be able to tell much. The text moves slowlyenough that it's easily readable and I think a user will get the illusion thathe has seen enough, when he actually hasn't - the majority of the text is simplynever drawn. With rxvt-unicode on the other hand, the text scrolls SO fast thatat least the user makes the correct judgement: he didn't catch the output, andmust use a pager or something.For the record, with Soren's patch as-is, the benchmark finishes in under 20seconds but the amount of text output is pitifully small. This, as far as I'maware, is changing gnome-terminal in the same way KDE's terminal has changedrecently (boost speed by massively reducing the amount of text output) and Ireally feel that's the wrong direction to be going in.++I might have been using a slightly more demanding theme and since the slider isrepainted immediately after changes, it might have been more visible for me.(I'm using the aquativo theme.)I'll just attach all my changes I've currently done in a big cumulative patchwhen I'm back on my machine.We should also try to use roughly the same benchmark, so we know what we aretalking about. I'm using time gnome-terminal --disable-factory -x <command>where command is one of {cat|hexdump} {configure|src/vte.c} for the default testor I run time <command> in a maximized window (40x150).++here are some times that I came up with: My X server is on a machine on the LANbut terminals are run on my local machine.

Even locally on my gentoo box,my results show it to be slower(please don't flame me, because I am the only onesaying this) than g-t and xterm....g-t has patches applied only from bug 122656 .vte has URL highlight turned off as described in 122656. The URL highlight wasthe biggest slow down and removing which made it faster than everything else.++It might be worthwhile to comment out #define NO_SLOW_LINK_SUPPORT insrc/features.h of urxvt to get a more comparable benchmark for this case, as bydefault urxvt will try to save bandwidth by using xcopyarea when run without alocal display (the effetc of which cna be seen by the amount of data transferred).XCopyArea can slow down scorlling a lot, due to the high number of eventturnarounds that this generates, but it is rather effective when using aterminal emulator over  aslow line.If you wanted to do the urxvt author a favour you could also try withouttransparency and with the most current version (3.7+), as urxvt's wekanessesinclude transparency,a nd it would be nice to find out why urxvt suddenly becameso slow compared to xterm :)It is very interetsing that xterm is slower than g-t. So I expect that g-t willalso be faster than urxvt even without the bandwidth optimizaton.Is this with gnome-terminal not refreshing every screen or does it still showevery screenful?++g-t refreshes every screen...I have urxvt 3.6 and turning off transparency didnot make much difference(avg. about 35secs). for urxvt, I think its veryconservative about the amount of data it sends to X server in one request and Ithink if I change NO_SLOW_LINK_SUPPORT, I might get better results. I will postlater with that.turning off URL highlight and g-t patch in 122656 made a HUGE difference in g-tperformance, without those and even with patch in bug 143914 , I had near 100%cpu usage when I moved mouse and 2-3 seconds delay when selecting text in a g-twith lot of text. On solaris the slowdown is very prominent because of slowerregex impl.++urxvt +ip with NO_SLOW_LINK_SUPPORT defined: time /bin/ls -R /usr/share -> 38 secsurxvt +ip -fn 7x13 -> 1.362 secs. its all about AA fonts, isn't it? g-t leadsthe pack so far with AA.++I have never measured a slowdown of more than 3 times for aa-fonts (andcetrainly never heard of urxvt beign slower on aa-fonts than other terminals :).something clearly goes wrong in urxvt that, unfortunately, would require quitesome digging on your setup.Thanks for doing the additional benchmark, the result is very interesting, Itserves to show that being fast on soem amchines does not mean being fast on allof them (and/or that rxvt-unicode must have a big bug somewhere :)++"" Reassign bug to owner of selected component ""++Well, it looks like this bug is still with us, despite everyone's best efforts.In particular I appreciate the patches here (and in bug 143914 ) but none ofthese solve what I see as the basic problem: when text should not be scrolling,e.g. if you are examining the scrollback buffer, or if the window isinvisible/minimized, gnome-terminal still soaks up tons of CPU time and unlessyou have an extremely fast X server for your hardware, even _more_ X time.With all that in mind, and given that gnome-terminal/vte are (IMO) far toocomplex for what they actually do, I ask the following:- Can anyone come up with a short list (5 or 10 points or so) of the things thatgnome-terminal does, which rxvt-unicode *doesn't do*? Personally, there is onlyone feature of G-T I miss when using rxvt-unicode: I can't hit ctrl+shift+N topop up a new terminal in the current working directory.- What would people think about dropping the current gnome-terminal codecompletely, importing rxvt-unicode, and rewriting whatever functionality ismissing (i.e. the menubar+configuration, things like ctrl+shift+N etc), to havea complete looks-alike, works-alike (but 20x faster!) replacement forgnome-terminal. Is this crazy?I just don't see how either gnome-terminal or vte are going to get significantlyfaster without being rewritten. And since we have an almost-perfect, open-sourceterminal program already (i.e. rxvt-unicode), why not adopt it? It is too goodto be ignored, I think.++there's also mlterm. opensource, transparency capable, and unicode-enough ;)well...there is one thing that gnome-term can do and rxvt-unicode cannot:gtk2 input modules.if you only write in latin-based languages, this is not an issue.but when you try to write in japanese or chinese for example you need much morecomplicated input method support.and that's where the gtk2 system uses the input modules.rxvt-unicode only uses XIM which is far less usable than gtk2 input modules.mlterm at least can use UIM natively, which is better than XIM, but still notthe gtk2 level.imho this would be a stopper for rxvt-unicode or for mlterm.because imho it's quite understandable that the gnome devels want the gnometerminal app to be able to use the gtk2 input modules.++OK, what the heck, I use terminals (almost) every waking moment of my life....So the previous $100 competition is over - sorry, no winners. My hope, roughlyspeaking, was that someone would make gnome-terminal less stupid, not make itact stupid more quickly. Having said that, the patches are appreciated (I do usethem, and they help) - Benjamin and Soren, I'll email you now with how you cancollect your $20 consolation prizes. ;)Well, time for a new bounty? $100 to the first person who, before December 252004 (yes, it's my christmas present to myself this year...), implementswhatever extra functionality rxvt-unicode needs such that I can't distinguish itfrom gnome-terminal except via performance. CHEAT: all this means is that youhave to get rxvt-unicode to do the following: 1) ctrl+shift+N pops up a newterminal window in the current working directory, ctrl+shift+T does the samething but in a tab, 2) the current command appears in the title bar, 3) a menuwhere the font and size can be selected using the GNOME font selector and wherethe colours may be chosen using the GTK colour dialog.A bonus $25 if your new terminal is adopted into mainline GNOME. (I guess thatmeans it'll need gtk2 input-method support. An extra $25 on top of that if itleads to the old gnome-terminal being thrown out! Yes, that's a potential $150up for grabs! Surely that covers the day or two it would take to implement. :)Someone, anyone, please make my christmas a happy one this year. :)++So, this really needs to be gone through and patches applied. No use in having abunch of improvements in here if they don't get commited and released...++Absolutely. This might not be the last word on gnome-terminal, but there aresome real improvements here and they should go in. FWIW, I've been using some ofthe patches (mentioned) herein for the last few weeks and they've made adefinite improvement.++The biggest problem IMO is that vte needs a backend/frontend separation.There are lots of redraws triggered (sometimes instantly, like the scrollbar) byrandom side effects and it's very hard to figure out from looking at code ifsomething schedules a redraw. Another bad side effect is that it sometimesdoesn't redraw even though it should (like when entering text while the CPUutilization is peaked).At least those were my impressions from working with the code.++""ping!""Does anyone (Kjartan?) know if any of the patches here are going to be appliedto mainline in the near future? Or indeed, if anyone has any news at all onthings related to vte/gnome-term performance...++Duraid: VTE is totally and completely unmaintained.

So I thought I would minimize itso that the output isn't shown. But that didn't do any differance, still about95% CPU usage. Then I un-minimized it again so I would see the output, and thenI moved another window over gnome-terminal. This lead to CPU usage below 5%!So why is CPU usage 95% when gnome-terminal is minimized but 5% when it iscovered by another window?++I should mention that this was on gnome-terminal 2.10.0.++Kjartan, do we need this scrollbar patch still?++Behdad, no need for it.

76081,gnome-control-center,Background,s/picture/image/,"I don't agree with Seth at all that we should use the word ""picture"" - ""image"" is NOT a computer term, it's a perfectly normal English word, used in many very usable and UI-expert-reviewed applications.According to both me and gnome-dictionary, ""Picture"" connotes a likeness ofsomething, usually a photo or paint-on-canvas. If I have an abstractpattern like most of our wallpapers, those are not pictures, they are justimages or designs.Moreover every other application on the planet on every platform prettymuch says ""image"" not ""picture"" - the word picture here is just _weird_ and_surprising_ and generally makes me slow down and think ""wtf?""So I think both the capplet UI and the schemas should be fixed to use""image"" not ""picture""Or if not ""image"", ""wallpaper"" would be OK. But ""picture"" is broken; most of the options we have available are _not_ pictures.++When referring to a photograph / other objects that get classified aspictures, we should try to use the word ""Picture"". Most people arefamiliar with the word ""Image"", yes, but its a level of geek-speakthat people don't use in their daily lives. ""Hang the image up there"",""Take an image of me with me dog please"", ""I'm going to paint an imageof a dog"". I fail to think of a non-technical context where peoplereally use the word image. In cases where ""picture"" doesn't apply, such as more abstract designson a package, I think we're more likely to use specific words like""pattern"" rather than ""image"". (now this is changing for some people,because, as you've pointed out, computers use image left and right,but I don't think this is true of any but the most geeky)*Except* in a professional/technical context (publishing, computers,papers about modern art) I think the word ""image"" goes largely unused.There are lots of words that people understand, but using them in thecomputer makes it seem stuffy and unnecessarily technical. Now forexample, in GIMP, using image would be appropriate, because it is partof the jargon of the imaging (heh, heh) and publishing world.Furthermore I think the word ""picture"" can and is naturally used torefer to more abstract designs, and least in the context of ""paintinga picture"". e.g. that phrase, to me, does not connote paintingsomething ""photo-like"" and could just as well be a completely abstractset of colours and lines. That said, most of my background ""images""are photographs, I don't know how this breaks down for other peoplethough.So here is the tradeoff in my mind:""Image"" is more accurate and will satisfy the pedants and technicalelite who have come to prefer the term. Further, other programs suchas GIMP use the word ""Image"".""Picture"" is the word that is used *much* more commonly and naturallyin RealHumanInteraction(TM)In Windows or MacOS I would have no problem choosing ""Picture"" andthen pushing on Applications to change where appropriate. In GNOME, asignificant percentage of our user population falls into the ""pedantsand technical elite"" category.So while I wouldn't be strongly opposed to changing to ""Image"", I donot think it is as good a choice. I think its a mild example offoisting technically accurate but uncommon jargon on users.++>""Image"" is more accurate and will satisfy the <b>pedants and technical>elite</b> who have come to prefer the term. Just a hint, Seth- calling the people you're arguing with names[because you do clearly associate 'elite' with elitist, otherwise youwouldn't use the word] doesn't really make your argument more persuasive.What do Windows and MacOS use in their background settings, anyway?++FWIW, pedants was intended as name-calling (and I don't consideranyone associated with this discussion to fall into that category, butI'm quite sure that a number of pedants will find Picture bothersome),technical elite is (and was) not to be name calling. We're all amember of this class. If I were designing the interface for myselfalone I would probably use Image. Its a more precise term. Its justnot a conversational word, and I think it makes the computer seem morecold than necessary.++Updating all cc bugs that have the GNOME2 keyword set to the GNOME2.0 milestone,to help jrb triage/prioritize cc bugs.

I seem toremember we changed ""pixmap"" to ""image"" in a few places during thelast ui-review, but I forget if we chose ""image"" rather than ""picture""for any particular reason.++btw, I don't feel so strongly on this either way anymore, presumablybecause I've gotten used to it in the meantime.++I have reviewed the definitions of image and picture in the onlineAHD, and I see no reason not to use picture.  Picture is a class of image: ""A visual representation or image ...rendered on a flat surface."" This definition fits with the use of theterm in the UI.My initial feeling was that image was more accurate, but the AHD hasspoken!++and with eugene's comments i'm going to wontfix this, but if anyone feels i'm overstepping my bounds i guess reopen.Eugene:Any chance picture can be added to the gnome dictionary of terms.++I will include the term picture next time I am updating the Recommended Terminology in the Style Guide.++I need to reopen this bug. A mail sent by Jeff Waugh to the usability list last week ( http://mail.gnome.org/archives/usability/2002-November/msg00071.html ) started me thinking about this again. The mail proposed a number of menu items (Open As Image, and so on).I looked at the AHD definition of picture again, and it does say that a picture is an image that >>represents<< something, which suggests that a picture represents a real-world object, individual, or location. So a picture is a class of image that represents something in the real world. The examples in the definition in the AHD support this. Now that I look more closely at it, I think my first reading of the term picture (earlier in the bug) was rather blunt. Picture is the correct term to use if we are talking about representations of the real world. But in the Background preference tool, the images we use as the background can be either pictures or non-representational images (mine are about half pictures, half other images). If picture is a class of image, is it really worth our while making this distinction in the UI? If a user must choose a representational image/picture and not any other type of image, then picture is the correct term. But if it does not matter what type of image the user chooses, then I think that image is the best term to use, as it includes representational and non-representational images.Reopening ...Cc-ing John and Irene also ...++Anyone want to make a decision on this one for 2.4?

92896,gedit,general,gedit won't save file in some instances,"Package: geditSeverity: normalVersion: 2.0.2Synopsis: gedit won't save file in some instancesBugzilla-Product: geditBugzilla-Component: generalDescription:Description of Problem:If you own a file, and that file is in a directory for which you don'thave write permission, gedit will not let you save your changes.Steps to reproduce the problem:1. Find a directory that you don't have write permission in, but thatyou can access (i.e. /usr/local/bin).2. As root, touch a file and chown it to yourself (or chown an existingfile).3. As yourself: open this file in gedit, make some changes and then hit""save"".Actual Results:An error box will pop up saying 'could not save the file ""xxxxxx""'.Expected Results:You should be able to save the changes to the file.How often does this happen?Every time.Additional Information:If you make the directory writeable to yourself, then you can save thedocument - no surprises there I guess. This does seem to be specific togedit, not to the filesystem, since I can open the same file in neditand it can save changes.------- Bug moved to this database by unknown@bugzilla.gnome.org 2002-09-09 20:09 -------Reassigning to the default owner of the component, maggi@athena.polito.it .++Confirming with 2.0.5. This may be gnome-vfs?++No, it is not a gnome-vfs problem since we are not using it for savingfiles.++This is due to the way gedit saves files.ATM, it needs that the file directory is writable since it saves atemp file in the directory.If a backup file has to be created, then the original file ""test.txt""is renamed ""test.txt~"".Finally, the temp file is renamed ""test.txt"" (ad the original hownerand permissions are restored).I don't see an easy way to fix this bug using the current algorithm.Probably we should change the algo we are using but we should be verycareful in order to do not have regressions on other old problems.Federico: Any idea? A part from ""Man, Unix sucks"" :-)++I am currently working on a fix for this bug.  I'll post a patchhopefully within the next couple days.++What nedit does under these circumstances - when it discovers it can'tsave the backup version of the file - is to notify the user that ""thebackup file cannot be saved, so for this session backups are nowdisabled"" (or words to that effect). So you can still save yourchanges to the existing file, but there's no fall-back in that instance.++Ok, I like the nedit behavior, i.e. we should tell the user that geditis not able to create the backup file and ask her if she wants to savethe file anyway.Matt: please note that gedit-document is a non-GUI class, so you needto manage this problem using exceptions (i.e. GError).Have you thought about using gnome-vfs to save files? You should beable to find a preliminary patch on the gedit mailing list.Thanks.++Matt: are you still working on it?++Yes, I am.  I'll have an initial patch soon.  I'm also addressing theissue of backups for special files (e.g. links) and files owned byother users -- these can't safely be backed up by renaming theoriginal file, because their attributes cannot be preserved.  I'mplanning to emulate the default ""backupcopy=auto"" behavior of the Vimeditor: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/vim2html2.pl?page=options.txt#'backupcopy 'That page has a good discussion of the issues.  Hopefully in the longrun we can get some of this code into a gnome-vfs API, so that eachapp doesn't have to reinvent it.++Status update:  Still working on this.  Fell behind a bit because ittakes a long time for my computer to download and compile the GNOME2.1.0 libraries now required for CVS gedit.++Matt: any news?++No, sorry -- I haven't had much time for hacking and have had troublekeeping up with Gnome 2.1 CVS.  I may pick this up again in a fewweeks, but for now if someone else wants to work on it please go ahead.++Matt: any news?++No, still not working on this, and no plans for it right now.++I couldn't access the vimtohtml discussion, and apologizeif I am repeating what was said there.The attempt to write the temp file could fail   a) because the temp file name exists and is read only  b) because the directory is read onlyOne solution is to reset the edited file to zero length(equivalent to cat /dev/null > /usr/local/bin/fred.txt)and then write the file directly. This would preserve thefile's flags.This runs the risk that a failure occurs and the user isleft without the old or new versions of the file. To offsetthat one might try copying the original file somewhere elsebefore updating it, e.g.   cp /usr/local/bin/fred.txt > ~/.gedit/backup/fred.txt   and now write new data to /usr/local/bin/fred.txtmv's don't work if the directory is read only but cat's do.by writing to the original file the flags are preserved.I would recommend informing the user where the backup of theoriginal file has been placed and why it couldn't have beenplaced at the usual location.++From VIM documentation:'backupcopy' 'bkc'	string	(Vi default for Unix: ""yes"", otherwise: ""auto"")			global			{not in Vi}	When writing a file and a backup is made, this option tells how it's	done:	""yes""	make a copy of the file and overwrite the original one	""no""	rename the file and write a new one	""auto""	one of the previous, what works best	Making a copy and overwriting the original file:	- Takes extra time to copy the file.	+ When the file has special attributes, is a (hard/symbolic) link or	  has a resource fork, all this is preserved.	- When the file is a link the backup will have the name of the link,	  not of the real file.	Renaming the file and writing a new one:	+ It's fast.	- Sometimes not all attributes of the file can be copied to the new	  file.	- When the file is a link the new file will not be a link.	The ""auto"" value is the middle way: When Vim sees that renaming file	is possible without side effects (the attributes can be passed on and	and the file is not a link) that is used.  When problems are expected,	a copy will be made.	One situation where ""no"" and ""auto"" will cause problems: A program	that opens a file, invokes Vim to edit that file, and then tests if	the open file was changed (through the file descriptor) will check the	backup file instead of the newly created file.  ""crontab -e"" is an	example.	When a copy is made, the original file is truncated and then filled	with the new text.  This means that protection bits, owner and	symbolic links of the original file are unmodified.  The backup file	however, is a new file, owned by the user who edited the file.  The	group of the backup is set to the group of the original file.  If this	fails, the protection bits for the group are made the same as for	others.	When the file is renamed this is the other way around: The backup has	the same attributes of the original file, and the newly written file	is owned by the current user.  When the file was a (hard/symbolic)	link, the new file will not!  That's why the ""auto"" value doesn't	rename when the file is a link.  The owner and group of the newly	written file will be set to the same ones as the original file, but	the system may refuse to do this.  In that case the ""auto"" value will	again not rename the file.++BTW, I think we should try to implement a simple solution (like theone used bu nedit) in time for gnome 2.2 and then starting discussingand implementing a more complex one (like the one used by VIM).++Okay, I have created a revised version of gedit-document.c thatimplements the nedit behavior. I haven't added an explicit warningto the end user though, as I suspect that it is perhaps too latefor the translators.

The first half implies that it will returnGDK_WINDOW_FOREIGN windows when appropriate, the second halfimplies it won't.If you hide a window, then restack its siblings, then _show_unraisedit, is it defined where it shows up? (Eg, above the same window itwas before, below the same window it was before, at the samenumerical position from the front/back, etc?)The documentation implies gdk_window_hide and gdk_window_withdrawdo exactly the same thing. (Or maybe, they do they same thing fortop level windows and you shouldn't call gdk_window_withdraw onchild windows? But that still makes gdk_window_withdraw useless.)gdk_window_iconify/stick/maximize and a bunch of other things shouldsay explicitly that they only work on top-level windows, though Iguess the reader can infer that whenever it talks about ""the windowmanager"", it's a function that only works on top-levels. (Then again,it looks like gdk_window_set_geometry_hints can be applied to achild window?)If you set geometry hints, are gdk_window_resize and _move_resizeconstrained by them?If you gdk_window_scroll by an offset larger than the offscreenportion of a window, does it stop scrolling when it hits the end,or does it go off the end?Do the gdk_window_shape things work on child windows or just top-levelwindows?What does gdk_window_get_frame_extents return if you call it on achild window? (""Don't do that""?)++A few of the answers, for addition to the docs later:Probably the (for example) shoudl just be removed, or it couldbe changed to (if the window belongs to another applicationand a #GdkWindow hasn't been created for it with gdk_window_foreign_new())Restacking deals with all siblings, visible or not visible.Yes, we always do gdk_window_withdraw() on toplevels now... hidingwithout withdrawing violates the ICCCM.gdk_window_move / move_resize() are not constrained by geometryhints.There seems to be some misunderstanding of gdk_window_scroll() ...it scrolls the _contents_ of the window, it doesn't move thewindow in its parent or something.

Portions of the window thatthe scroll * operation brings in from offscreen areas are invalidated.+++ * This function is not constrained by geometry hints set using+ * gdk_window_set_geometry_hints()I think that statement is a little confusing - for toplevelwindows in X11, the window manager will typical constrainthe size to any geometry hints that are set.I think it probably would be best to omit any reference ofgdk_windwo_set_geometry_hints() for move/resize/move_resize[ why is it in move anyways? ] and then explaini the behavior in detail in the set_geometry_hints() docs.A quick pass at some appropriate text:; This function provides hints to the windowing system about acceptable sizes for a toplevel window. The purpose of  this is to constrain user resizing, but the windowing system will typically  (but is not required to) also constrain the current size of the window to the provided values and to constrain programatic resizing via gdk_window_resize() or gdk_window_move_resize().  Note that on X11, this effect has no effect on windows of type GDK_WINDOW_TEMP or windows where override_redirect has been turned on via gdk_window_set_override_redirect() since these windows are not resizable by the user. Since you can't count on the windowing system doing the constraints for programmatic resizes, you should generally call gdk_window_constrain_size() yourself to determine appropriate sizes.++I committed the patch with the suggested changes."

Ihave verified the problem still occurs with the latest evolution, 0.10+cvs.2001.04.12.08.00.I noticed at least one similar bug report, with a response that it seemedtoo confusing to start the recurrence on a Wednesday (in the case of thatbug) but have the recurrence be on Sundays.  That would be confusing, butthat is not the problem.The problem is that one is forced to start the recurrence on the currentday, rather than on an abitrary day.

Depending on the filter outcome, the new email is putin one of the 3 maps.When I want to see if I've got email, i used to look (in evolution 1.0.8)at the shortcuts bar to see how much new mail was in each folder.It was displayed as:Inbox (3)SchoolWork (2)Sometimes, I won't see these numbers after the mapname, and sometimes I do.That's very confusing. And it requires me to click on each map individualyto see the map contents and look for new email.How often does this happen? Sometimes. Not every time...++After some more testing, the amount of new emails shows up behind thework and school map but not behind the inbox map.There is a visual difference between the maps.Inbox has a different icon than the others; School and Work icons areenvelopes while the inbox icon is like .. an envelope put in a'mailbox'.

216246,evolution,general,Need to redesign the searchbar,"The searchbar has several serious usability and funcionality problems,and it needs to be redesigned. We now have much more data about how peopleuse it(from usability testing, the mailing lists, bugzilla, irc, etc) thanwe did when we first designed and implemented it, and now is the time toincorporate that data into improving it.I created an evolution branch for my usability testing purposes, and havebeen incorporating the feedback I recieved from the first round of testinginto it. A screenshot for what I have done so far is availble at: http://primates.ximian.com/~anna/evo11/search-bar.html . I need somehacking  help from someone to connect the Search menu items (now locatedunder the ""View"" menu) before I'll be able to test this on users again. The sooner someone can help me with this the better.  New functionality I would like to see implemented includes support formultiple word quick-searches (""Body contains: Sue's address"") andprogressive searching; unforunately, right now, I have no idea how to dothe UI for progressive searching. (So maybe this will have to be postponeduntil 1.4. not sure. )  Other problems that need to be fixed are: When doing an advanced search,you should have some indicator of which criteria you are using (currentlythe option menu just says ""Advanced..."" which is not very helpful.) We alsoneed some re-wording and more useful defaults in the Advanced Search dialogpeople seemed to be unable to find/use the and/or functionality.  Most other apps I looked at (KMail, Outlook XP and Express, and Eudora)show search results in a separate window; this would be one way to dealwith progressive searching. We should consider doing this. Anyway,enough for now. Comments? Thoughts? I'd welcome your brainstorms.++This is ui's job until a ui is created.++FWIW progressive searching cannot be implemented without architecturalchanges.++We should just drop progressive search for 1.2.  The re-design (i.e.the moving of the Search menu and addition of the clear button) shouldstill be pretty easy to do.++I dont understand why you want to make searches harder to run.BTW the search bar, the quick-search and the saving of searches is allintegrated into a single object.  This is a big change for no gain.++Please look at the attachments that I am adding to this bug. The onlything I've changed is the ""Search"" drop-down menu. It has beenreplaced by a top-level ""Search"" menu, and a ""Clear"" button. If you refer to http://primates.ximian.com/~anna/searchbar/evo-window-new-menu-and-bar.png ,(also the first attachment to this bug), you will see the mainevolution window. Note the ""Clear"" button, and note the presence ofthe ""Search"" menu, between the ""Tools"" and ""Help"" menus.The ""Clear""button should only be active when there is something to clear. And the""Find Now"" button should only be active when there is something to find. Now, refer to http://primates.ximian.com/~anna/searchbar/search-menu-mailer.png (also the second attachment to this bug) . This is how the ""Search""menu should look in the mail component. The ""Family Mail"" and ""Sue'sPhone"" menu items represent saved searches. The ""Find Now"" menu item should not be active until there is somethingto find.. that is, until the user has entered something into thesearch entry. In that respect, it should be identical to the ""FindNow"" button. Along the same lines, the ""Clear"" button should only be active whenthere is something to clear. Ditto with all the other menu items. Ctl+B and Shift+Ctl+B are not, as far as I can tell, bound toanything, and should be suitable shortcuts for ""Find Now"" and ""ClearSearch"". Look at http://primates.ximian.com/~anna/searchbar/search-menu-addressbook .and http://primates.ximian.com/~anna/searchbar/search-menu-calendar-and-tasks.png (attchments 3 and 4 respectively) . These screenshots depict thecontents of the ""Search"" menu in the addressbook and calendar/taskscomponents. Please, implement these changes in your respective components, guys.This should be really simple.. I was able to get rid of the Searchdropdown and hook up the clear button myself, and I have approximatelyzero C hacking skills. I am not asking for a huge change. Oh. One more thing. Please make searches of more than one word work.Everyone I tested this on thought the current searchbar was totallybroken when it failed to show them results for multiple word searches. This is how every other mail client with a gui search handlessearches, and there is no reason for us to be an exception.++Created attachment 41000  [details] Evolution Window w/ Search Menu and Clear Button++Created attachment 41001  [details] Search Menu (Mailer)++Created attachment 41002  [details] Search Menu (Addressbook)++Created attachment 41003  [details] Search Menu (Calendar and Tasks)++Currently all the code for the search bar is handled in a singlesimple gtk object.  This new design requires a lot of custom code in each component, andworse, interaction with the bonobo menu system.  Basically a completeredesign of the search bar code and its api.So, its not ""really simple"" at all.BTW If you want the search bar to handle multiple words, submitanother feature request.I'm sitll not sure exactly what this bug is for apart from makingsaved searches harder to use.++Whether it's difficult or not is besides the point; we have allocatedone week for this, which is probably plenty.(BTW the search bar can be implemented as a control, or it can justget a pointer to the BonoboUIComponent and feed the menus through itinstead of using GTK.  I don't think it's such a big deal.)++Hi Michael, I've been thinking about your comments about the need formaking saved searches easier to use, and have a possible solution. Please look at http://primates.ximian.com/~anna/searchbar/search_accelerators.png .This idea numbers the saved searches, and assigns accelerators to thefirst ten. I know this isn't perfect; you can only have acceleratorsfor the first ten saves searches this way, but.. I think this sufficesfor most people whose usage patterns I am faniliar with. What do you think? We can assign a mneumonic to the ""Sender contains""option menu too.++Alright.  Since Michael refuses to co-operate, I am doing this.++Yay, done on CVS."

575614,orca,speech,Please add speakable characters: → and ←,"Orca currently does not speak the u+2192 and u+2190 characters in the subject, however it is used several places in gnome translations, with the most appearances in gimp-tips[1]. Also, several times translators use* these either instead of -> and <- or just because it's more convenient this way to express things like menu hierarchy relations[2] or source->target relations[3]. The left pointing arrow is used too at some places, and also RTL languages could use it.*: I'd like to use these extensively, because -> is ugly and can break in two at linebreaks, which is even more uglier. But, I have a blind user at hand, who is ready to throw rotten things at me if I break something from a11y POV :)[1]: http://l10n.gnome.org/POT/gimp.gimp-2-6/gimp-tips.gimp-2-6.pot [2]: from gnome-games.HEAD.bg.po:msgid ""--> Room""msgstr ""→ Стая""gnome-bg/development/ekiga.HEAD.bg.po:msgid ""No video will be displayed during this call->""msgstr ""По време на този разговор няма да се показва видео→""[3]: from gnome-games.HEAD.hu.po:msgid ""Black pawn moves from %(start)s to %(end)s""msgstr ""Sötét gyalog lép: %(start)s → %(end)s""++Do you have a recommended English translation for these characters?  The issue I'm wrestling with is what to do in speech.  The GUI developer obviously put these characters in the UI for brevity, and we'd like to keep similar brevity in speech, yet make sure the purpose of the character is clear.The problem I'm wrestling with is that → and ← are used in many ambiguous ways.  So, the best we might be able to do is say ""right arrow"" and ""left arrow"" in speech.  For the gnome-games case, however, speech would end up saying the equivalent of ""Black pawn moves from %(start)s right arrow %(end)s"" in Hungarian because the translation chose to use ""→"" as the translation for ""to"".++Will, sorry my long answer.

The character is the '▸' character, which is a whole different character.  I believe it is U+25B8, which is the ""BLACK RIGHT-POINTING SMALL TRIANGLE"" > This situation left arrow and right arrow translation is not right, because> this is a menu text. This is the point I make in comment #1 .  The character used is the character used.  I'm not sure we want to make Orca be responsible for getting into the mind of the person who chose to use that character.  For example, I don't think we can reliably make the decision that a person used '→' to mean ""moves to"" versus something else.  Or that '▸' means ""go to submenu"" versus ""play"".I believe the most reliable thing we can do is provide some semblance of the string the Unicode designers chose for the character.  So:▸	25B8	 	BLACK RIGHT-POINTING SMALL TRIANGLE→	2192		RIGHTWARDS ARROW←	2190	        LEFTWARDS ARROWKeep in mind there are many many many (did I say many?) unicode characters.

How many similar triangles are there> in Unicode? There seem to be quite a few: http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/geometric_shapes.html There's white ones, black ones, big ones, small ones, etc.  I don't think Orca should be the judge of what should or should not be spoken.  Small vs. regular amd white vs. black might make a tangible difference in meaning on some pages, for example.++(In reply to comment #6 ) > Yes, black right pointing small triangle is too lenghty my openion.> My ydea:> Choose the System ""menu"" Settings ""menu"" anything menu item.> Because no difference the main ""system"" menu markup and ""settings"" submenu> markup character, I use the menu simbol with english translation.> The perfect description is following, but impossible doing if I known right:> Choose the System ""menu"" Settings ""submenu"" anything menu item. I agree it is verbose.  HOWEVER, Orca does not know that the meaning of the triangle in this context is ""menu"" by looking at the text.  All it knows is that there is a character there and the character is a small black right pointing triangle.Having said that, the HTML markup ends up looking like this, where the whole thing is surrounded by <span class=""menuchoice"">......</span>:  To enable GNOME accessibility features from a GUI, run the   <span class=""menuchoice"">    <span class=""guimenuitem"">System</span> ▸     <span class=""guimenuitem"">Preferences</span> ▸     <span class=""guimenuitem"">Assistive Technology</span>  </span> Potentially, one could attempt to create a custom script that attempts to interpret the CSS to guess what word(s) should be used to speak a given symbol, assuming ""menuchoice"" is a well known tag.  I believe what they will quickly find is that this information is not exposed to Orca via the AT-SPI (I could not find it anyway).  As such, we're back to Orca just knowing that a small black right pointing triangle is present.So, providing the semantic interpretation of symbols based upon their context is something that is outside the scope of this bug, and is also something where I don't believe Orca is given enough information to make a decision.  So, to bring us back to this bug: this bug is about providing spoken text for the left and right arrow characters.  The patch provides that and also adds text for the small right pointing black triangle.  In the spirit of trying to keep bugs to a specific thing, I can happily strip out the black triangle text and we can open a separate, likely-never-to-be-addressed, enhancement request that Orca provides a semantic interpreter for characters based upon the perceived context.++Well, then the easiest way to go is to ask gnome-doc-utils developers to ditch this annoying triangle in favor of the right arrow :).++Bug #582098 filed.++(In reply to comment #10 ) > Bug #582098 filed.

532918,orca,magnification,It's unable to launch magnifier of orca in gdm login window.,"Please describe the problem:It's unable to launch magnifier of orca in gdm login window. Steps to reproduce:1.Setup gdm login window.2.Move the mouse cursor from bottom in and top out, then from left in and right out. Actual results:Magnifier couldn't be launched and the system halted.Expected results:Magnifier should be launched.Does this happen every time?Yes.Other information:Hardware: X86 Operating system: snv_89+vermillion_90.++System did not hang. Magnifier was launched but it did not work. The display is masked. The Composite extension is enabled on that box too. It looks like a bug of GDM. Copy this bug to Brian for more investigation.++I can confirm this on my Tecra M2 laptop with Nevada 89, Vermillion 90, and Orca from trunk.  The screen ends up being entirely greyed.  I can eventually Insert+Q and then Alt+Q to quit Orca to get back to the login window, so this seems more as though the magnifier is misbehaving than the system hanging.If I log in as a regular user, the magnification works fine, however.  So, something funky might be happening with the X environment for the gdm session, though I have no idea what it could be.++For more thoughts on this:1) I wonder if the gdm login screen is started in such a way so as to prevent COMPOSITE from working well?2) If #1 is true and is unfixable, I wonder if we should try bringing the magnifier up in split screen mode for gdm.++The Xserver as launched by GDM is the same Xserver that is used for the end-user session, so there shouldn't be anything unique about how the Xserver is running or configured at login time versus the user session.You say that the Magnifier is launched but fails to start?  Could you provide more details about what the failure might be?  To debug this, you could define a gesture to start up a terminal window in the /etc/X11/gdm/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents file (or the AccessDwellMouseEvents file).  Then try to launch the command to start the magnifier by hand.  If there are any useful error or warning messages that get echoed to the screen, this would likely help figure out the nature of the problem.  Also, you could use the terminal to run the magnifier with a debugger like dbx to step through the code to figure out the nature of any problems.++I remember I tried to start magnifier in terminal, but didn't find useful messages. Start magnifier with dbx may help.++Just a note: it's not that the magnifier doesn't start.  It's that the magnifier starts, but just completely grays out the whole display.  If one starts it via Orca (i.e., Ctrl+m in gdm), you can press Insert+q, press the right arrow once, and then press return to quit Orca.  If you do this, the display comes back to normal.I added the following line to /etc/X11/gdm/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents:<Control>t  1 1000 10000  xterm -fn fixedThis allows me to bring up an xterm from the login screen by pressing and holding Ctrl+t for more than a second (and less than 10).From there, I ran ""magnifier -h"" and ""magnifier -v"".  I'm seeing the grayed behavior.  If I run ""magnifier -h --ignore-composite"", however, I see the appropriate magnification behavior.  This leads me to wonder if the COMPOSITE extension is just somehow confused when running under gdm.While in the xterm, I did an xdpyinfo and saved the results.  I then did an xdpyinfo when logged in and compared the two outputs.  Here's the diffs, where ""<"" is where something is from the user session and "">"" is something from the gdm session:bash-3.2$ diff /tmp/user.txt /tmp/gdm.txt 19c19< focus:  window 0x420000f, revert to Parent--- > focus:  window 0x100000d, revert to PointerRoot 73,77c73,75<   current input event mask:    0xfa8033<     KeyPressMask             KeyReleaseMask           EnterWindowMask          <     LeaveWindowMask          ExposureMask             StructureNotifyMask      <     SubstructureNotifyMask   SubstructureRedirectMask FocusChangeMask          <     PropertyChangeMask       ColormapChangeMask       --- >   current input event mask:    0x5a0003>     KeyPressMask             KeyReleaseMask           StructureNotifyMask      >     SubstructureNotifyMask   SubstructureRedirectMask PropertyChangeMask I'm not sure if the diffs are enlightening at all.  But, I did some more searching and came across this KDE bug, which makes me wonder if GDM and COMPOSITE just are not friends: http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152595 ++(In reply to comment #6 ) > I'm not sure if the diffs are enlightening at all.  But, I did some more> searching and came across this KDE bug, which makes me wonder if GDM and> COMPOSITE just are not friends:> > http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152595 This may be a red herring.  I added ""--override-redirect"" to the exe line in /usr/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_Magnifier.server:    type=""exe"" location=""/usr/bin/magnifier --override-redirect"">This seemed to allow magnification to work a little better (but not perfect) on the login screen.From http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/window/attributes/override-redirect.html :""To control window placement or to add decoration, a window manager often needs to intercept (redirect) any map or configure request. Pop-up windows, however, often need to be mapped without a window manager getting in the way. To control whether an InputOutput or InputOnly window is to ignore these structure control facilities, use the override-redirect flag.""gnome-mag's magnifier.c makes the following choice, depending upon whether the flag has been passed or not:GtkWindowType mag_win_type = GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL;if (_is_override_redirect) mag_win_type = GTK_WINDOW_POPUP;I don't know enough about what's going on here, but I wonder if gnome-mag should turn on override-redirect if it knows it is going to be in full screen mode?Alan and/or Carlos, do you have any thoughts?++Hmmm, I find this about the override redirect flag: http://osdir.com/ml/gnome.accessibility.devel/2007-03/msg00046.html I don't know if there are more important use cases. Maybe if you change this:    if (_is_override_redirect) mag_win_type = GTK_WINDOW_POPUP;to something like this:    if (_is_override_redirect || _is_using_composite) mag_win_type = GTK_WINDOW_POPUP;can solve the problem.I will provide a patch later.++Willie, I don't see much information in the KDE bug you highlight, aside from just another example of composite causing problems.  In the KDE example, the problems seem to be with the user session rather than with anything to do with magnification.Has anybody tried testing this feature with the new GDM rewrite (version 2.22 or later) and see if it behaves any better?  Note the new GDM uses metacity as its window manager, so such a test might clarify whether the window manager is the difference causing the problem.++(In reply to comment #9 ) > Willie, I don't see much information in the KDE bug you highlight, aside from> just another example of composite causing problems.

I'm experiencing the problem on Ubuntu and OpenSolaris with gdm --version == GDM 2.20.7.  I haven't tried the later stuff.  Do you know what the official GNOME plans are for what version of gdm will be rolled into GNOME 2.24?++I suspect the problem is with how gnome-magnifier negotiatesSTRUTS when using composite.  This makes sense since the --override-redirect option is used to control whether STRUTS should be used or not.  Since it works okay in non-composite mode, I think it is unlikely the STRUTS negotiation is broken on the GDM side.Looking at the gnome-mag code I see this code in the function gmag_gs_check_set_struts in magnifier/x11/gmag-graphical-server.c:#ifdef HAVE_COMPOSITE        if (gmag_gs_use_compositor (magnifier))                return TRUE;#endifand it avoids actually doing the work of setting the X properties toactually set up struts properly.  This looks like the bug to me.++(In reply to comment #6 ) > I added the following line to /etc/X11/gdm/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents:> > <Control>t  1 1000 10000  xterm -fn fixed> > This allows me to bring up an xterm from the login screen by pressing and> holding Ctrl+t for more than a second (and less than 10).> grrr!!!

I'm getting the flicker as well -- I upgraded to a newer version of GNOME on my box (GNOME 2.23.5) and can no longer get the xterm trick to work.  Arrgh.  Looks like there have been some changes in this space that have made things break.  :-(++The most strange is that I can't launch orca in Ubuntu 8.04 (GNOME 2.22.3) neither xterm.

Yech - debugging this is so frustrating for us!  :-(  I believe I was on GNOME 2.22.2, but I blew that system away in favor of going to the latest stuff.Brian - it's been a very very long time since I've worked on X Window System internals (1996?).  Do you know of some other way we might be able to launch an xterm on the gdm window?  I've tried su'ing as gdm and displaying to :0, but I think some xauth thing might be getting in the way.++For those complaining about gesture listeners not working with GDM 2.22/2.23, you should be aware that the ""gesture listening"" feature has been dropped in the rewrite.  This feature only works with GDM 2.20 and earlier.  If you want to use gestures, don't update to 2.22/2.23.  If you want to use the new GDM, then it supports an autostart directory (/usr/share/gdm/autostart I think) where you can place a desktop file, and the application associated with that desktop file will autostart with GDM.  However, this new mechanism is either autolaunch or neverlaunch, there's no way to launch on-demand.Note that the new GDM also defines the commands to launch AT programs differently.  I believe it uses GConf keys and does not use configuration files in /etc/X11/gdm/modules, like AccessKeyMouseEvents or AccessDwellMouseEvents.So if you need to change the commands used for launching AT programs, you probably have to mess around with this stuff.  I don't think there is a GConf key for launching xterm, so you have to use the autostart mechanism mentioned above.  Having said all that, keep in mind that GDM 2.22/2.23 is bleeding edge stuff, and you should probably expect to find issues.  I don't think much testing has been done in terms of a11y yet.  No reason not to start now.  In terms of this particular bug, I don't think that it matters which version you use, since the bug seems to really be a gnome-mag bug.In other words, there is no way to launch AT programs via gestures in the new GDM.  This has been discussed at length on the gdm-list@gnome.org , and also highlighted a few times on the GNOME a11y mailing list.  Oddly, though, nobody has yet filed a bug complaining that the ""gesture listener"" feature has been removed from the new GDM rewrite.  Hopefully this doesn't lead people to think it isn't an important, useful, or used feature.  Perhaps someone from the a11y community should file a bug.For reference, Jon McCann has a vision that the gesture listenering feature will be rewritten into gnome-settings-daemon so that the same mechanism for recognizing gestures works for both GDM and also for the actual GNOME session. Not sure what timeframe he has in mind, though.  I suspect this won't get done in a GNOME 2.24 timeframe, though.Note that GDM 2.22 was not accepted by the GNOME release team, and I personally think it is likely that GDM 2.24 will also not get accepted.  I think GDM 2.26 is likely going to be what ends up getting into the next GNOME official release.  So, for now GDM 2.20 is the latest official stable release.  It is probably what you should be using to test with if you want to test against the stable code.  GDM 2.23 is what you should test with if you want to test against the unstable development code.++Created attachment 117401  [details]  [review] Patch to implement Carlos' suggestionThis patch modifies gnome-mag to use Carlos' suggestion in comment #8 to use a GTK_WINDOW_POPUP if the compositor is in use.  I don't know the internals of gnome-mag well enough to know if this is the right thing to do.  Implementing the suggestion was a little tricky since globals are used throughout gnome-mag.  In particular, the 'dpy' global wasn't initialized at the time the gmag_gs_use_compositor method was called.  So, I did the following:1) Check for the damage extenstion on the source display.  I *think* this is the right thing to do because my understanding is that the damage extension lets us know when something has altered on the screen -- we want this for repaints on the source display, right?  In any case, gmag_gs_use_damage uses the 'dpy' global whereas gmag_gs_source_has_damage_extension doesn't, so it was a quick change:-	if (!gmag_gs_use_damage ()) {+        if (!gmag_gs_source_has_damage_extension (magnifier)) {Then, in gmag_gs_use_compositor, I obtain the dpy from the target display versus using the 'dpy' global:+	Display *dpy;...+	dpy = GDK_DISPLAY_XDISPLAY (magnifier->target_display); 	if (XQueryExtension (dpy, ""Composite"", &major, &event, &error) && 	    !g_getenv (""MAGNIFIER_IGNORE_COMPOSITE"")) 		return TRUE;It seems to make things work again on the login screen and things remain working on the desktop.  Carlos, I'd appreciate a review!  :-)++Hmmm.. did you try with only the magnifier/magnifier.c modificaiton? I guess that with only this modification it must work.Your modifications in magnifier/x11/gmag-graphical-server.c aren't right at all.The gmag_gs_use_damage also verify if the user explicitly pass the --ignore-damage option, so in this case we don't use composite, since updates will be very painfull.Related with the modifications in gmag_gs_use_compositor, it's expected that the call gmag_gs_client_init was already called before calling any other function in magnifier/x11/*.c code. Maybe there is some side effects due this change, maybe not, I can't recall anyone now.++Hmmm.. did you try with only the magnifier/magnifier.c modificaiton?

Thus, the magnifier crashed 100% of the time with just this change.  :-(I'd definitely be happy to see a patch from you.  :-)++Created attachment 117426  [details]  [review] Simpler patchThis patch still tries to do Carlos' suggestion, but is simpler.

I agree. Could you update the patch to remove more code? After applying the patch, the code still checks if the icon is changed to error icon (like the try-catch block in Songs view).

This might need some priority changes, so that> discoverer is run in low priority. It won't change a single bit.At some point the idle fires (no matter how low the priority), GStreamer stats/opens/reads the file and at that moment the mainloop is blocked. If that takes more than ~10ms (which is likely, if there is other IO activity like loading the icons, accessing the tracker DB or simply something else in the system), you're dropping frames, and the app feels less responsive.idle_add() is *never* a solution to sync IO problems. In this case, the solution is either not discovering, or discover_uri_async() (which does all the IO in a different thread, and only reports the result to the mainloop)++Also, with the tons of idle_add()s you have, you keep layouting and drawing over and over, as every frame changes something in the scene, and Gtk doesn't really like that (especially the layout is quite expensive)++Created attachment 252131  [details]  [review] view: don't discover URIs synchronouslyDoing IO in the main loop is always a bad idea.

What's the status of the patch?++@joe:  Patch works fine.  Have to run memchecker though.  Let me verify it today and close this by today itself.  Sorry for holding this for a long time. :-)++A related question on filter behaviour: If a filter fails by throwing an exception, is it gracefully handled or it takes the whole indexhelper down with it ? There are all kinds of files out there; it doesnt take much effort to find a file that'll crash a filter !++Most of the cases are handled to skip gracefully.  Filters should probably wrap *text pulling* operations within a try-catch and fail gracefully.  I guess, doing a ""finished()"" inside catch in IndexText(), would probably make this one not crash beagle.++I would like to see all of these filters do just that.  Report the error and keep going.  For me, I would never see them because they run automated at 2am.  I would never know there was a problem.  Part of my job still is to run these by hand and watch them run every few weeks on the command line to see if they are going ok.++Exceptions in filters are handled gracefully, and the file is skipped.If there is a segfault, there's nothing we can do.  That's the benefit we have of using managed (c#) code whenever possible. :)++Ok.  The bug actually is triggered from wv, as it (appears to be) tries to read past the EOF.

I have filed a bug in bugzilla.abisource.com. > http://bugzilla.abisource.com/show_bug.cgi?id=10025 I am all confused (nothing new :P).The bug is in wv, I understand. Then what is the status of the attached patch ? Is it a workaround/ earlier attempt/obsolete ?I found something from irclogs:[21:35] <varadhan> and since the entire wv1 logic is based on callback mechanism.. I guess, I will manually maintain a total size and try to match it witch current charpos that is being read.Any update on this ?++I don't know if this is directly related, but our OLE filter was opening files using GSF's mmap() interface, which maps the files as MAP_SHARED rather than MAP_PRIVATE.  This means that if the file changed on disk, it would cause problems if the filter were in the middle of reading from it.  This particularly seems to be a problem when saving these files with OpenOffice, which triggers two inotify events, and causes the file to be indexed twice.I've just checked this in, so it'd be good if people could test it.++In case the issue still persists, use external filter. I just tried antiword on the attached ""buggy"" file.Using this in external-filters.xml,<filter>   <mimetype>application/msword</mimetype>   <extension>.doc</extension>   <command>antiword</command>   <arguments>-t %s</arguments></filter>and beagle-extract-content worked fine on the crasher doc file.++Dave, is this still an issue (not using the external filter workaround)?

It seems that vino/vinagre ignores AltGr (and CTRL+ALT) completely, so you cannot type any AltGr combinations. That's a *real* problem for instance for German users as some vital characters like @ and \ cannot be typed over a connection to vino/vinagre. I suppose that there may be similar problems for users of other European (or else) keyboard layouts.The problem does not exist when using vncserver/Xvnc, it exists only in the Gnome vnc server.++Similar problem over here:I use Vine Server on 2 Macs. On connecting to either of that machines I have a wrong keyboard-assignment.On Linux side I have a german (no dead keys) layout. On those Macs it's also german but if I connect it uses an english layout for that VNC-connection.For example if I type a "" (shift+2) it shows a Ä (special german character). Shift + 6 should enter & but gives me a \ on that remote machine... and so on.This is annoying because I can't inserting passwords on the remote machine is nearly impossible.Switching the Mac to use Hex-Input (->System Preferences -> International -> InputMenu) helps a lot but my special german characters don't work anymore.So being able to select a keyboard layout would be a great help.Just my 2 cent++Same here with slovenian keyboard layout. Cannot use any alt-gr character (@[]{}\|).++Same problem on my Hardy heron beta. AltGr has no effect on my (french) keyboard.BTW, i just figured out that CTRL-ALT gives the same result than AltGr should.++I can also confirm this using Vino 0.5.0 and spanish layout: AltGr has no effect.

The call to gdk_draw_drawable ignored the parameter expose_area andinstead redrew the progressbar completely rather than just the sectionthat needs the update. 2. The call to gtk_widget_map() was not needed and caused superfluousbars to appear in unexpected places.3. gtk_widget_size_allocate() is now only called when the sizechanges.  This should be quicker and fix a bug where if the sameGtkProgressBar is associated with two differentGtkCellRendererProgressBar cells when one is rendered,gtk_widget_size_allocate is called which causes the other cell to getrendered, this then calls gtk_widget_size_allocate and the two cellscontinue to provoke the other to get redrawn.  Nasty loop and CPU hog.4. Finally added the function,gtk_cell_renderer_progress_bar_update_tree_view(GtkTreeView *).This function invalidates the entire surface area of a GtkTreeViewwidget causing the progress bars and everything else to be redrawn. This should be called after any functions which change the way thatthe progressbars would be displayed such asgtk_progress_bar_set_fraction().It should be noted that I do not like this and if anyone has an ideaon how to tie changing the value of the progress bar to a region beingredrawn, please let me know.Thanks,Russ++Hi Russell,I'm trying the code. First of all, it needs gtkintl.h, I don't know why.Second, it requires a GtkProgressBar. If you look atgtkcellrenderertoggle.c you will see there is no GtkToggle propertybut ""active"", ""inconsistent"", ... instead, this is, it behaves as awidget, while your implementation needs that widget.Someone with more experience should comment on this though.++Please, look at the cellrenderer.{h,c} file in gnome-system-monitor.It looks like a good implementation to integrate in gtk+.++Kris had a bunch of comments on the progressbar renderer.  Can youpost them here, Kris?++Hi Manuel,Thanks for reviewing the patches and providing some constructivecriticism.  I am sure that they are far from perfect and could use afew more pairs of eyes on them.I agree there is no need to include ""gtkintl.h"" sorry about includingthat I must have copied it from gtkcellrendererpixbuf.  Speaking ofwhich is there a need for gtkintl.h in gtkcellrendererpixbuf?I have looked at the cellrenderer.{h,c} included withgnome-system-monitor and think that it has some significantshortcomings.  It has a single property which is a (double) value. The progressbar is then rendered based on this value.  This means thatthe application programmer cannot do the following things. (To myknowledge???) - Set the text on the progress bar to an arbitrary value or disableit at their discretion. - Set the GtkProgressBarOrientation. - Set the progress bar into ""pulse"" mode.It would be possible to write an implementation which had thesefeatures but there would then be a great deal of duplicated logic inthe rendering of the widget.  For this reason, I thought it would becleaner and easier to make use of the already existing GtkProgressBarwidget and let it do the rendering.Thanks again for looking at the widget.-Russ++First of all, I personally do not like embedding arbitrary widgets incell renderers. This is because certain complications will popup (likethe function gtk_cell_renderer_progress_bar_update_tree_view() whichyou had to add) and because it will never work 100% right.The progress renderer as found in gnome-system-monitor/procman comesmuch closer to what I have in mind. Though I agree that it is prettylimited.As I will need a progress renderer like this myself at some point, Iwill look into writing one. It will have more features than the onefound in gnome-system-monitor (and I prolly also want another sizerequisition system), but I am not sure exactly which.(For an actually unknown reason) I think it makes sense to exclude all animated progress types from the renderer, and thus basicallyimplement everything GtkProgressBar supports exluding the animatedoptions. I came to this when imagining a treeview full with discretepulsing progress bars, I think that will be way too busy. But I amprolly wrong here.I will update this bug once I have more information on the subject.(Probably after my feature requirement investigation ;)++Note that Epiphany has a progress bar cellrenderer as well(lib/widgets/ephy-cell-renderer-progress.[ch]).regs, Chris++I integrated the Epiphany progress cell renderer."

Simply read each object in order one after another.  Probley what is needed is to use flat review and read by zone.  The only tricky part is: if a piece of static text takes more than one line all lines of the text should be read before reading the next object.++Will and I discussed this today. Here are my notes:We will need to adjust the sayAll routine in default.py (around line 1567) to do something like:    if self.isTextArea(orca_state.locusOfFocus):        ...existing code...    else:        ...new code...where ...new code... is going to be a new method thatlooks something like:...        context = self.getFlatReviewContext()        context.goBegin()        moved = True        while moved:            moved = context.goNext(flat_review.Context.ZONE,                                   flat_review.Context.WRAP_LINE)            [wordString, x, y, width, height] = \                     context.getCurrent(flat_review.Context.ZONE)            ...speak/braille... wordString...Note that this doesn't handle multi-line text fields.

What do you think, Rich?Overall, I think this looks good and should be committed if Mike can clarify that we don't want to move focus ever (even when we interrupt speech).  That is the spec says ""In a dialog orca should not attempt to move the focus durring a sayall.""  So, that's during a sayall, but what happens when the say all completes or is interrupted?

What do you think, Rich? I don't know whether it's a gedit bug or not.ORCA_MODIFIER-Enter ""double-clicked"" does the right thing and onlyspeaks it once (although it does say ""lane 1 colonel 1""). But that uses:text = self._getObjName(self._statusBar)so it's going through a totally different code path and taking anentirely different approach.++Hmm...OK.  Well, I suppose we could work around in the flat review code so it will not dive into children of status bars if the status bar has non-empty text.  I just opened bug 506874 for this.We still need to hear from Mike on what to do when a Say All of a dialog completes or is interrupted, though.  I'm guessing he doesn't intend for focus to change in those cases and your patch is fine as is.  But, I just want confirmation from him.++ > We still need to hear from Mike on what to do when a Say All of a dialog> completes or is interrupted, though.

266678,evolution,Contacts,Renaming LDAP contacts CN breaks DN,"Description of Problem:When changing the ""Full Name"" of an existing LDAP contact, the old commonname (cn) component of the distinguished name (dn) is unchanged while theobject's cn value itself is updated.  This is (incorrectly) allowed byolder openldap servers (e.g. slapd 2.0.27-2.8.0 from Red Hat Linux 8.0),but not newer versions with strict checking (e.g. 2.1.29-1 from Fedora Core 2).Steps to reproduce the problem:1. Create a new LDAP contact, ""Mickey Mouse""2. Save and close it, then search and open it again3. Try and save the Full Name as ""Minney Mouse""Actual Results:Depends on the LDAP server - either silently creates an inconsistent cn/dnpair, or reports the failure to save. For example:$ ldapsearch -LLLx sn=Mousedn: cn=Mickey Mouse,dc=contacts,dc=netproject,dc=comsn: Mouse...cn: Minney MousefileAs: Mouse, MinneyExpected Results:It should modify the relative distinguished name (RDN) as necessary alongwith other attributes.How often does this happen? Always.Additional Information:I've worked around this for existing contacts by manually replacing the cnwith random new uid values in the dn using ldapmodrdn.  Since Evolutiondoesn't display or modify the dn or uid such changes should be transparent. Unfortunately any new contacts will still be susceptible since Evolutionalways creates them using the cn in the dn.  This also means no twocontacts can be created with the same name - perhaps that should be filedas another bug?++I've noticed this problem as well.++yes this is a problem, I think we should map disPlayName ldapattribute to full name instead of cn as stated in bug 232451 , that willthis problem as we won't be tocuing cn when full name is modified. Butthat may be too big change for 2.0.3, If we want to fix this now,proably we should do a a rename operation when ever cn is changed.++Thanks for your input Sivaiah.  Perhaps using displayName would workaround some immediate problems to allow Evolution to modify LDAPcontacts its created, but I still don't think would be a fullsolution.  The problem just gets moved from updating the cn to thedisplayName.  In general any LDAP object may have to have it's RDNmodified if it contains any attribute value being modified.  OtherLDAP clients may create contacts with arbitrary DN values, but atleast Evolution should be able to update its own creations.++Well waht are the other attributes that affect RDN ?, i thought it isonly CN. If we map display name to full name, then there won't be anyway to change cn from evo and hence no need to update dn. We willupdate displayname as we do for other attributes.++Perhaps fixing it to work for records created by Evolution is thepriority right now.  However other LDAP clients could create contactswith arbitrary RDN values that Evolution might want to edit.  In suchcases it would be proper to check the RDN for any modified attributes. For example if something added an RDN based on e-mail address andEvolution edited this, it would have to update both the attributevalue and RDN.If this problem gets properly fixed no display name work around wouldbe necessary.  However the new contact creation code would still needattention to allow multiple entries with duplicate names, which stillwouldn't work.++since evolution 2.0.x is not maintained/patched anymore, moving all targetmilestones at least to 2.2.x.sorry for the noise.++What is the proper fix for the problem ??Inputs ??++support rename :)++why is this set to NEEDINFO?++At the moment I can only rename people on LDAP contacts by using an external LDAP editor.  This is kinda annoying...++I am using Evolution 2.8 and this bug is still actual. I have been bitten both problems described in this bug:- Changing a full name results in an error (my LDAP server does strict checking)- Adding two contacts with the same full name is impossible.The addressbook I am compiling contains many contacts, that are not easily subdivided into different organisational units (something Evolution doesn't have an infrastructure either, but that's a different issue).The existing address book (currently still in an ordinary database) does have several contacts with the same full name. I can't currently use evolution to manage these contacts because of this bug.I have been looking for an alternative. For now I use luma ( http://luma.sourceforge.net/ ).Luma uses evolutionPerson as objectClass, so the LDAP records it creates are compatible with Evolution (with a few minor issues). It solves this bug elegantly:- ""description"" is used as rdn- ""description"" is composed of the contact's full name with some kind of serial number added. This serial number is the creation date with an addtional number.Luma's implementation has both pros and cons.Pros:+ This leaves cn free for full name. If the full name changes, the rdn doesn't need to change.+ The rdn's will never clash, because the serial makes them unique+ The rdn still shows some relevant information, which is useful when browsing the directory (or a search subset)Cons:- After initial creation, the description is never updated. If the full name changes radically, the rdn is no longer representative for the contact.- There is no option to choose how the rdn is composed.It may be worth to evaluate luma's solution for Evolution as well. The cons could easily be worked around if needed.++I am using Evolution 2.12.1 and this bug is still actual.It's VERY annoying, because it make interoperability with other LDAP almost impossible!I think the solution above would be the best and use displayName too...Any chance to see this fixed after over 3 years?++Created attachment 107139  [details]  [review] Patch which introduced rename and creates uid as RDNFirst version, against 1.12.1, but should apply to 2.22.x too, because very little has changed in betweeen (actually only one new helper function was added).++Hey Ross, Can you look into this patch?++Hello!I didn't hear anything for over a month now.Guenther stated, that you already took a look at the patch?!Can I help in any way?I would like to have some feedback...Regards Sven++Some explanations:This patch solves the problem by introducing (as stated in comment #8 ) renaming of an existing entry.

It seems it can. It depends on the flags set in compile time. When it's using g_new or g_strndup, then the application will abort, as stated in the help for g_new (<cite>If any call to allocate memory fails, the application is terminated. This also means that there is no need to check if the call succeeded.</cite>). The other path of the conditional compilation of that function uses other methods, where I'm not sure whether they abort or not on allocation failure. In other words, you've right, it's somehow possible to return NULL. What is the right thing to do in such situation? There is not much to do when one runs out of the memory, for sure.++Patch works fine. I am able to add/ modify/ delete contacts.

If you lookcarefully at the task list from the menu panel, you can see that thetasklist is flush with the edge of the screen.  On your bottom edgepanel, though, there are 2 extra pixels separating the tasklist fromthe screen edge. This can be verified by opening you screen cap in theGimp and zooming in on the bottom panel.Here is another way to test: try to click on a task on the menu panelwhen the mouse is moved all the way to the top of the screen.

Its a subtle thing but it makes a pretty bigdifference (most people don't notice it, because its not the sort ofthing people notice, but if you watch how fast Mac users access menusvs. versions of Windows where the start menu is broken this way, thedifference is substantial).

Garbage In, Garbage Out principan in action.++*** Bug 335703 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++Created attachment 61872  [details] More extremeThis should say ""officials"", it is the ""ic"" part that seems to be the trouble, as I have noticed this bug for a few days now, using Ubuntu 6.06.++I did a bisection search and it looks good with 1.11.0 but bad with 1.11.1. Did Pango start looking at some tables it ignored before?I leapt to the conclusion that it was a Pango bug because it only appears with recent versions of Pango and not with any other font software, but if there's something wrong with part of our font and only Pango even looks at that part, then that would also explain it.++Yes, with 1.11.1 pango started using the OpenType engine for Latin script too.  Look at the modules/basic/basic-fc.c that was revamped.  Previously it was doing fallback shaping, only applying the TrueType kern table, but now it's doing the recommended tables: GSUB ones: ccmp, liga, clig, and GPOS ones: kern, mark, and mkmk.So, you are not getting the same behavior with Qt?  We almost share the same OpenType layout code.++Nobody has _noticed_ this problem on Qt, or on other engines like Cleartype, but I can't say for sure.++Most likely nothing else you are testing with pays attention to thekerning tables.++Created attachment 61914  [details] Qt4 has no problems with kerningThe problem does not occur with Qt4 (attached screenshot is made from textedit, one of Qt4 demo programs)Scribus, the only Qt3 I know that has kerning, has no problemsAnd OpenOffice 2 also has no problems with kerning++And how does the same string using the same font look under Pango?++Created attachment 61916  [details] screenshot Qt4/Pango with DejaVu Sans and DejaVu LGC SansHere's what Qt4 with DejaVu Sans 2.4 looks like compared to Pango.DejaVu LGC Sans does not overkern with Pango.Another side effect of having Arabic in DejaVu Sans is anchors not working anymore. Removing all Arabic anchors fixes it. But that might be Fontforge not writing clean tables. I don't know if anchors work on other platforms. ""ë̌"" <e, U+0308, U+030C> should stack cleanly.There two issues to be dealt with, the overkerning one apparently DejaVu Sans 2.4 + Pango specific, and the inconsistant kerning.++Note that putting Arabic into DejaVu Sans is a shockingly bad idea,and I don't think it's worth even thinking about investigatingproblems with it. (The main reason it's a horrid idea is thatArabic fonts and Latin fonts don't have compatible metrics.)That being said, one problem per bug report please!++Seems Fedora is hit too: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=186662 (also see the discussion on dejavu lists: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=15185495 )As for Owen's remark in comment #20 :1. if you mean this is a shockingly bad idea because the tools are not ready and we've been caught with our pants down I can only agree2. if you mean multi-script fonts should be prohibited or you can ignore them that's another thing altogether. Users want multi-script fonts. There are few now but there were few unicode systems some years ago too. fontconfig substitution is a short-term fix, not a long-term solution (if only because yhe aliasing rules are not the same on other systems and ignored by non-fontconfig apps). People are making Vera derivatives at last (which was the original aim, remember), all sorts of scripts are beind added and then consolidated in dejavu, get over it and please make it work.I still remember the bad old ASCII days where you could create any dual-document you wanted, as long as one of the langages was english (because the only character overlap was in the latin part). Now that fonts are catching up, let's get rid of the last remnants of this situation.++You mean you do whatever users want you to do?  Ignore the users, design and solve the problems with developers.  We write the software, we know how fonts are handled, not users.  We know the problems of multi-script fonts, not users.  Lets get over it, don't ruin all the beauty of fontconfig, instead fix its bugs.++With current technology, combining scripts with incompatible metricssimply does not work. You'll either get overlapping lines, or hugelyspaced out lines.(Greek, Latin, Cyrillic are compatible, probably also Georgian, Armenian,Ethiopic, etc. Arabic, Thai noteably incompatible. Indic scripts alsoincompatible though a little less strongly.)If you add BASE tables to the font, and adapt every piece of softwarein use, you may be able to get it to work. But then you've created away of using fonts that isn't compatible with what other platforms do.fonconfig/Pango do a reasonable job of combining multiple fonts; thereare some issues with sizing and baseline alignment that need work, but those are best addressed in the context of multiple fonts; afterall, doing typography with multiple fonts for multiple scripts issomething that needs to work!If you have someone that wants to draw a Arabic design that coordinateswell with Deja Vu, great!, release it as Deja Vu Arabic. But don'tgo down the FreeSans rathole of throwing fonts together in the blindand unreasoned pursuit of coverage statistics :-)The only font that I know of that has coverage outside of latin-likefonts and ""works"" is Microsoft's Tahoma, and that achieves a uniformline spacing by using unusual and strange looking variants of scriptslike Thai that are readable but not normal typography in that script.++Owen,it's not a  blind and unreasoned pursuit of coverage statistics; it's what users want.The fantasy of dedicated script fonts is just that, a fantasy :1. All the ""dedicated"" fonts overlap, especially in the core latin parts so you can not reasonably ""combine"" them2. Even if they did not overlap asking the users to manage font collections because of technical problems just does not work. Users are always more stubborn than technologists. They want a single font. Are you ready to embark on a crusade to convince them they're wrong ?I'm afraid this is something FOSS will have to tackle and solve by itself. As long as major closed software editions are segmented by langage they just do not have the incentive FOSS distributions with their large i18n coverage have.And that means FOSS font designers releasing fonts with large coverage (as the dejavu people are kindly doing) but also the FOSS GUI infrastructure people figuring out how to display them.Maybe the solution is to add a new table to fonts which allows managing all these scripts in a single file ? If the (numerous) existing font tables have unsolvable limitations.We've already created a way of using fonts that isn't compatible with what other platforms do. Just write a document that references a fontconfig alias, and try to display it the same way on another platform (or a fontconfig system with a different aliasing table for that matter). Trying to work like everyone else is good but only as long as everyone else has solved your problems.If you separate fonts then combine them at fontconfig level you're as incompatible with other platforms as if you relied on a table other platforms can not read (yet)Today I don't see a good way to do multi-script documents. And in a globalized world, they're more and more numerous.To answer Behdad.I won't pretend to know how the software work. But I've been exposed to many many multi-script documents (from nuclear powerplant plans to textile automation brochures). And the #1 problem every time was how software insisted on separating the langages (by font, encoding, whatever) when every single document user wanted a common presentation.Go in a store. Read the doc that comes with any piece of electronic kit nowadays. I'll be very surprised if most of it is not in multiple languages and if the doc creator didn't expend a lot of efforts to make all langages equal (very bad for business if pakistanies think indic scripts are bigger/better/more favoured than arabic). FreeSans and dejaVu didn't go the same route to get coverage statistics. They went the same route bacause that's the route users ask for.++> The fantasy of dedicated script fonts is just that, a fantasy : It rather seems to me that you are chasing the fantasy of a workingall-scripts font here. Not a good sign for including deja vu as thedefault font in Fedora, I'm afraid.++This is interesting discussion should probably happen on gnome fonts list or the internationalization list instead of here ;).Irrelevant of whether a many-script font is a good thing or not, it should work with Pango as it does with other font renderers.Should we open a different bug report for the kerned/not kerned issue since this one seems to focus on DejaVu Sans with Arabic OT tables?++Sorry Denis for helping on hijacking your bug...Nicolas: No, that is not users want.  Users don't know what fontconfig is, users don't know how font selection is done, users don't know all these things.  What users want is that their software works.  If the simplest way to give them that for you, the font developer, is to stuff every glyphs somebody contributes into a single bin, this bug is the result, let everyone suffer it.All Microsoft fonts with Arabic glyphs are absolutely ugly for Persian, the Arabic glyphs in DejaVu will definitely be ugly for Persian too, for a very simple reason:  Arabic fonts are ugly for Persian speakers.  Persian simply prefer other styles.  Persian fonts and Arabic fonts are not suitable for Urdu.  And these three languages share the same script, aka the Arabic script.  So, no matter how much effort you put into making the Arabic glyphs in DejaVu perfect, it will be:  1) Not needed for 5 billion of people in the world that don't know Arabic, you are just making a lean Latin font, a huge pig now.  2) Unusable for Persian and Urdu speakers, a good few hundred millions, and they cannot easily use DejaVu with their favorite Persian/Urdu font anymore.  3) Not necessarily the style they want to use with their DejaVu font for those who actually are Arabic speakers, and again, you have made it harder for them to choose which font to use for which script.You may want to take a look at fontmanager project that is being developed and at other efforts to solve this problem, instead making a decision based on what end-users say.  When you design new fonts, you should also write a good fontconfig configuration file for them.  I've done that for Persian, and the result is beyond anything you can ever achieve using the single-font approach.Moreover, developing a font for a single script is already hard enough.  Instead of adding more and more glyphs, DejaVu developers may want to stop for a while and do some testing on their fonts before pushing them on millions of desktops.    I've been watching the Pango bugs for a few years now, and I don't need to tell you how many bugs have been reported here for say Bitstream Vera Sans, and how many for DejaVu Sans...Of course, one can fork DejaVu and divide it into multiple fonts anyway.++Does Pango support BASE table?  If it supports it well, how is ""different metrics"" relevant?++No it doesn't.  Even Pango does, Qt doesn't, and Firefox doesn't.++(In reply to comment #27 ) > Sorry Denis for helping on hijacking your bug... And I'm very sorry, but I have to answer :(Behdad, all you're saying is something I already know, that is current fonts lack info to compose them sanely. You're proposing to put this info in fontconfig files, or in gconf keys managed by fontmanager, or whatever (and there I'm ROTFL since Owen's first argument was to avoid creating away of using fonts that isn't compatible with what other platforms do.)Your first postulate seems to be fonts as they are today are hopeless, and you have to fix them from the outside. But here you have a font design project which is ready to help you at the font design stage.Instead of creating a fontmanager that will probably be used to map from scripts to fonts (like the firefox one today which is so complex I defy you to find people which have changed more than 2-3 langages) how about :1. defining which glyphs needs alternatives (info wolrdwide projects like gnome can collect)2. put these aletrnative in predefined slotsand just have the whole thing work as-is ?You'll probably object this will lead to the creation of very fat fonts, but distros will install all the split fonts anyway, and these split fonts will probably overlap in the latin range, so splitting won't win anything except for LFS installs++(In reply to comment #27 ) > Moreover, developing a font for a single script is already hard enough. > Instead of adding more and more glyphs, DejaVu developers may want to stop for> a while and do some testing on their fonts before pushing them on millions of> desktops.

But here you have a font design project> which is ready to help you at the font design stage. Yes, we trust you guys to know what you're talking about, so give us some recommendations. We say it's a Pango bug, you say DejaVu is messed up, well, what's wrong with it? How should we fix it? We'd be willing to consider anything as long as it doesn't screw up our rendering on Qt or Windows.++Well, the pangoheads already spelt out the options:1) split off scripts which are incompatible from a font-metric point of view   like Arabic2) work on support for OpenType BASE tables in pango, which can theoretically   overcome the font metric problems. In this case, you have to live with the   fact that your font is broken in every piece of software now, and in every   piece of software except pango after the BASE support is completed and   released...++About the kerning issue:Testing with DejaVu shows that the problem is probably caused by the right-to-left anchors needed for Arabic: removing these anchors from DejaVu solves the problem.++Nicolas: All I'm saying is that I don't want anybody to *force* it on me which Persian font family to use with my favorite Latin font family.  That's all.Keenan: OpenType tables are full of numbers.  One of them is wrong and you see bugs like this.  Qt is not using OpenType tables for Latin I guess.  And did anyone test the offending font&sequence on Windows actually and it did work?  If it didn't, it's definitely a font bug.  If it did, it's either 1) a font bug, hidden by a windows bug, 2) a Pango bug.  In both cases, we don't have any problem to change Pango to render the font correctly. We have had other cases of this, see bug 101079 and bug 170180 for cases where a buggy font was rendering fine on Windows, and not with Pango, because Pango is much more restricted and standard compliant that Windows.  BUT, somebody has got to debug the problem and come up with a conclusion that either Pango or the font is not following the OpenType spec, for this particular reason, here in this place, and here is a fix.  I've done that in the past, and am willing to do if somebody attaches a small test font.  But with a monstrous font with thousands of table entries, I'm afraid it's not me.++The overkerning in DejaVu Sans can be fixed either by removing the Arabic anchors, or by changing the kerning pairs currently present. All the kerning pairs are marked for the ""cyrl{dflt} grek{dflt} latn{dflt}"", changing that to just ""latn{dflt}"" fixes overkerning and diacritics stacking. Unless it has any secondary effects, it seems to be the best fix since we can keep Arabic anchors.The inconsistent kerning does remain as for other fonts.++I still think someone should figure out *why* that's happening.++I made a simple font with basic Latin and Arabic. With ""Te"" kerned for ""cyrl grek latn"" and ""To"" kerned with the same value for ""latn"".There is only one anchor (rtl) for the base U+0637 and the mark U+64B. http://home.sus.mcgill.ca/~moyogo/fonts/test/Jaja-Arabic.ttf If you test it with ""Te To طً"" you'll see it reproduces the bug, ""Te"" is overkerned compared to ""To"" and the diacritic is not placed according to the GPOS table.++I'm happy to understand in this thread why my GNOME desktop look so ugly.Just my 2 cents in this discussion:I don't look for fonts that cover ALL Unicode glyphs in one file (it's a bad technical approch), but fonts that render very well in one or more defined Unicode scripts.I also look for fonts able to render multi-scripts documents in a correct way.As an end user, I would like to simply choose the family ""Vera Sans"" in the font selection dialog of Abiword or OOo and the font engine choose for me the more appropriate font {script|file|...} between ""Vera Sans LGC"", ""Vera Sans Arabic"", ""Vera Sans Persian""... depending of my locale, default language of the document, paragraph, <choose what you want>As a power user, I would like the same font selection dialog box let me bypass the automatic font substitution by specifying the full font name or render script.For now, I really prefer fonts that render very well for some defined Unicode scripts, that fonts full of glyphs that render badly in any scripts.I switched from ""Vera Sans"" to ""Vera Sans LGC"" for this reason except for ""Vera Sans LGC Mono"" that render very badly in gnome-terminal.++It appears to be a problem upstream, fixed here - http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page++(In reply to comment #12 ) > Created an attachment (id=61872) [edit]> More extreme> > This should say ""officials"", it is the ""ic"" part that seems to be the trouble,> as I have noticed this bug for a few days now, using Ubuntu 6.06.

Which is a compromise you made, and others may have made another one.Situation would be different if there was a perfect solution, but all I see here is people writing at each other ""your compromise suck because of <insert personal situation>"" mine is better (and will handle your problems someday probably)If FOSS font projects (FreeFont, dejaVu) go one way (full coverage, someday the renderer will handle it) and rendering go the other (split everything, someday the font tools will reassemble it) everyone will lose (somehow I don't see Behdad drawing the font families he asks for nor dejaVu rewriting pango).All that has been established do far is there's a lot of work to do.++I think enough of font discussion here.  Back to the bug.++Just so this is written down somewhere. The overkerning occurs with fonts that have kern pairs or classes set in more than one script. For example DejaVu Sans 2.4 had its kern pairs in ""latn(dflt),cyrl(dflt),(grek(dflt)"". Fonts like Calibri (from Vista Beta) will display the same behavior in Pango. Pango applies the kerning for the pair for each script, instead of just one.The weird part is that DejaVu Serif has a similar definition for kern pair but Pango only applies it once.Maybe Calibri and DejaVu Sans have bad tables but other font shapers seem to do fine. It could be argued that fonts should not do this or do that, but what should we do, have a more flexible library or fix each font (including professional ones) that's not to its liking?++Ok, I hereby declare that a Pango bug :).Here is what's happening in the OpenType basic module:    for (i = 0; i < G_N_ELEMENTS (scripts); i++)      {         PangoOTTag script_tag = FT_MAKE_TAG (scripts[i][0], scripts[i][1], scripts[i][2], scripts[i][3]);         guint script_index;         if (pango_ot_info_find_script (info, PANGO_OT_TABLE_GPOS, script_tag, &script_index))           for (j = 0; j < G_N_ELEMENTS (gpos_features); j++)             {               PangoOTTag feature_tag = FT_MAKE_TAG (gpos_features[j][0], gpos_features[j][1],                                                     gpos_features[j][2], gpos_features[j][3]);               guint feature_index;               /* 0xffff means default language */               if (pango_ot_info_find_feature (info, PANGO_OT_TABLE_GPOS, feature_tag, script_index, 0xffff,&feature_index))               {                 pango_ot_ruleset_add_feature (ruleset, PANGO_OT_TABLE_GPOS, feature_index, 0xffff);               }             }So we simply add every feature for every script to the ruleset...The solution is the fc-modules revamp that Denis and I have been talking about.  Ideally, I think we should be keeping one ruleset per script-language pair.++I am currently Pango 1.14.5 and DejaVu 2.7 on Ubuntu 6.10.

No.++The bug occurs when a kerning pair (e.g. ""Te"") is contained simultaneously in several GPOS tables, e.g. latn{dflt}, cyrl{dflt} etc. Pango accounts this distance multiple times probably summing. Obviously it should do it once picking a value from the suitable table, not the all.++*** Bug 440975 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++This is fixed btw."

350773,banshee,Device - Karma,Transcode operates on files with no extension,"Refer to http://mail.gnome.org/archives/banshee-list/2006-July/msg00120.html for the impetus for this bug report.  Summary follows:As I understand it, in Dap.cs, Banshee takes the list of all tracks that are supposed to be on the device (including those that are already on the dap added by loading the database) and sends them all to transcode.  Transcode skips any files that have an acceptable extension.  Finally, the core invokes the Dap's own Synchronize method which can then discriminate between tracks on the unit and those that need to be added.On the iPod and other players, this doesn't matter because the files on the device retain their extensions.  However, on the Karma, all uploaded files get renamed to a number without an extension.  Transcode() will then deem that these are not 'acceptable' (even though they are on the device), so it will then do a pointless transcode, storing the newly transcoded file on the device as cached_filename.I have a patch which first checks to make sure that files input into transcode are 'known' file formats; i.e. the file has to have an extension of mp3 or wav or whatever to be considered for transcoding.  This will exclude files already on the Karma from being transcoded since they don't have extensions.  I'll attach this.This is really the only thing lacking to make the Rio Karma DAP plugin work.++Created attachment 70662  [details]  [review] Check for a known extension before transcoding something++Created attachment 76340  [details]  [review] Check for known extensions before transcoding++Created attachment 80217  [details]  [review] Rebased to subversion of 01/13/2007++component should be changed to karma++The bug 348730 was blocked by this one and that has been resolved; however, this bugs latest patch is newer than the resolution of that bug. Either I'm confused or there is a conflict in information here. Bob could you clarify and if the patch still needs to be applied, confirm that it is good on SVN? I'll add abock to the CC if this is still unresolved so he'll get the update.++AFAIK this patch still needs applying, or a different approach should be taken.  The patch in bug 348730 was applied and gives users the ability to play tracks from the DAP and sync -- *if* they delete all of the files on the device first.The problem is that if they sync and there are files on the Karma, it will unnecessarily transcode those files on the device because they have no extension and the transcoder uses the extension to decide whether to transcode it.  IMO the transcode shouldn't consider the files that are on the device at all, and the fact that it works for ipod and all the rest is a happy accident.As for alternate approaches, adding a flag to DapTrackInfo to know whether the song is on the device, or calling back into the dap plugin to ask if a file should be transcoded, either of these would work for me.  I'll code them up if abock has any input.  If the approach of the patch below is deemed ok, then I'll rebase it in a day or two."

Don't waste your time, this dialog is 100% code. It's also a dynamically createddialog which makes using libglade virtually impossible.++Hmmm, never mind that bit about the table. The way the code works makes using atable a BAD idea as we don't know how many parts we need we can't makeassumptions on how wide a certain widget should be.

I'm not 100% sure why F-Spot shows different information to what Banshee shows, i'll check that out.- Playback doesn't workThis is disabled on purpose because a file on an mtp device cannot be accessed like a regular file and so banshee can't access it to play it.- Banshee crash when trying to open the metadata editorThis is an old issue which i actually fixed earlier today.

590309,gtk+,Printing,Default cover pages for CUPS printers incorrectly set,"Please describe the problem:It looks like GTK+ assumes that all printers on a CUPS server use the same cover page defaults.  GTK+ will assign a variable (cups_backend->covers in function cups_request_printer_list_cb of file gtkprintbackendcups.c) to the value(s) associated with the first job-sheets-supported field that it sees coming from the CUPS server.  So, instead of each printer having its own cover page defaults they will all have the cover page defaults of the first printer found on the CUPS server.Steps to reproduce:1. Create a CUPS printers.conf file with two printers named A and B.2. Add a JobSheets entry to each printer stanza.  The JobSheets for printer A should be ""none none"" and the JobSheets for printer B should be ""standard none"".3. Start an application that uses GTK+.4. Go to the Print dialog.5. Select printer A.6. Go to the Job tab and note the default cover pages for printer A.7. Return to the General tab.8. Select printer B.9. Go to the Job tab and note the default cover pages for printer B.Actual results:Both printer A and printer B will show default cover pages of None (before) and None (after).Expected results:Printer A should show default cover pages of None (before) and None (after) while printer B should show default cover pages of Standard (before) and None (after).  This would accurately reflect how they are configured on the CUPS server.Does this happen every time?Yes.Other information:++Created attachment 139852  [details]  [review] get default cover sheets from printersHi,this patch modify the cups backend to get default cover sheets from each printer separately.RegardsMarek++Looks fine to me, please commit.++Committed:  Get default cover sheets from each printer separately  Fixes bug #590309 .

When it popped up the dialog asking whether I wanted to save the changes, I accepted. The changes were saved and the register closed. Seemed to work perfectly. So although the description above is quite specific, perhaps some additional conditions not mentioned above are needed to reproduce the bug.By the way, there are several other bugs that show crashes from reaching a g_assert() via gnc_split_register_destroy().

The key seems to be frame 13.In the 2.2.5 code, line 2392 of split_register.c is the first g_assert_not_reached() call in gnc_split_register_cleanup(). So this the same point of failure as the other three bugs I mentioned in comment 1 .From reading the code, the only way that line can be reached is:(a) there is a pending transaction but no blank split, or(b) there is a blank split, but it doesn't belong to the pending transaction++I have committed a debugging patch as r17506. This does NOT fix the bug, but should provide some new information when it recurs. If you can reproduce the problem, please check your trace file for additional information that will help us diagnose the problem. The line will contain the phrase ""BUG DETECTED"".++I've figured out a way to reproduce this problem in trunk:1. Open a register.2. Click on the date of any existing transaction.3. Edit->Copy Transaction4. Go to a different existing transaction.5. Edit one of its splits (expand the transaction if needed to see the split lines)6. Click back on the date of the same transaction.7. Edit->Paste Transaction8. Close the register.++I've committed r17962, which fixes the method described in comment 4 .

Also, I'm going to mark as new.++I'm not longer getting this issue when i log inbut I'm still getting it when nautilus crashes.I think the startup issue depends on which finishes loadingfirst: the panel or nautilus.++Ok: more infoTo Reproduce: run 'killall nautilus'When nautilus respawns it redraws the desktop, first with the background color then with the image. The panel gets drawn withthe color but not with the image.[OT]Maybe nautilus should not draw the background color if there is animage set as it just *flashes* for a second++Okay, I've spent a while debugging this.The problem I'm seeing is that on Nautilus startup the gradientbackground is first drawn by Nautilus, it updates the _XROOT_PMAP_IDproperty and the panel updates correctly. However, the background thenchanges to the image background but _XROOT_PMAP_ID is not changed.The problem here is that the second background rendering run is notdone by nautilus-directory-backround.c:image_loading_done_callback butis done in response by EelBackground in response to whatever the hellis going on internally.The fix, IMHO, is for nautilus-directory-background to be notified ofthis EelBackground internal rendering run and for it to create a newpixmap with the latest contents.Maybe a ""background_pixmap_changed"" signal emitted fromeel_background_ensure_realized might do the trick.Upping to ""Major"" as this is pretty horrible for anyone who usestransparent panels.++mark: Are you sure about that analysis?It looks to me like the panel just doesn't properly tile thebackground image.++Ah. I just had an old panel.++Ok. I ""fixed"" this. The real cause is thebonobo-realizes-widget-at-wrong-size, which caused the loaded image tobe scaled to the wrong size, then when realize arrived it wasasync-loaded again, so i just checked for this and postponed thepixmap rendering until it was fully loaded again.OTOH, that fucking bug is biting us all over the place. Both inperformance (all backgrounds read twice) and in flicker. We *need* tofix it. Mark, have you ever looked into it?++Good stuff Alex.No never looked into that. At first guess though, I can't see how itcould be avoided. You need to realize the plug before you embed it inthe socket, so how can you know the initial size ?

104018,metacity,general,Buttons clicked don't deactivate when mouse leaves while still holding down mouse button,"Currently in Metacity, when one of the frame buttons is clicked, it turnsactive. But if the mouse is moved outside the button before it is released,the button remains active, as if it will still be activated when the mouseis released. This is not the case; if the mouse is released outside thebutton, the button will NOT be activated, but there is no indication thatthis is the case. Throughout the rest of GTK/Gnome (and other operating systems), when abutton is pushed and the mouse moved outside of it before a release, thebutton is deactivated, to signify that the button will not be activated ifthe mouse is released where it currently is. Metacity is currently gettingthis behavior right, but it is not indicating that this is what will happenbeforehand. This patch makes it indicate this behavior by deactivating the buttons whenthe mouse is moved outside of them before a release.

Currently,you put the mouse over a button, it prelights, and then you push down.When you release the button, it's still prelit, so momentarily, itflashes the prelighting on. When you fix the activation thing, lettinggo far away from the button will still cause that prelighting to flashon momentarily, which looks much weirder when the button was alreadynot prelit.

The current behavior is veryconfusing.  just my 2 cents...++I agree, read the attached IRC logChanging summary++*** Bug 114013 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++Paolo,Some further thinking regarding this, because I'm starting to thinkgedit moving between workspace has some annoying secondary issueswhich can't simply be resolved using the --new-window flag.Okay, try this.1. Open a gedit window.2. Click open file.  Note that the default directory is ~ (your homedirectory.)3. Click cancel to shut the Open File dialog.4. Move to a new work space.5. Open a terminal.6. Type 'cd /tmp' and hit enter.7. Type 'gedit --new-window' and hit enter.8. Click open file on the new gedit window.  Note that the defaultdirectory is still ~ (your home directory.)One of the great thing I love about launching applications from thecommand line is that it effectively uses the current directory as thedefault directory.  Unfortunately, the --new-window option doesn'thandle this appropriately negating much of the benefit of being ableto run mutliple gedit windows.Also, having to type --new-window to get a new instance of gedit is aPITA.As a result of experiencing these behaviours, I would propose thatgedit, should:* Open a new window each time it is started.* Set the default directory according to where gedit was started.The current behavior is confusing, and interfers with expectedfunctionality.++*** Bug 119429 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++From bug #128541 :New documents should not be opened in tabs if document not opened throughfile->openI had a gedit window with a new document opened on one desktop.I opened nautilus and was looking at my files.I double clicked on one, and it opened in gedit.The existing gedit window moved to the new desktop, and opened thedocumentin a second tab.I finished with the document and closed the window.Got a dialog asking to save the file...  (Save the file?  I didn'ttouch it!)So I clicked okay.Bam.  Lost the old document.This behavior is confusing and annoying.  And it just caused me tolose data.++*** Bug 128541 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++I strongly agree with comment 21 . New documents should not be opened in tabs ifthe document was not opened through an existing instance of gedit via ""File ->Open"" (or the ""Open"" button on toolbar).Even if there is already a running instance of gedit on the current workspace,and I open a separate document from a separate directory from nautilus, itshould still open as a separate gedit window with it's own distinct workingdirectory.Of course, it would still be nice to be able to drag the tab from the newergedit to the older gedit, and vice-versa, even though people would rarely needto do that.++Is this really an enhancement, or is it a bug?++*** Bug 143341 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++just a reminder: galeon has some utility code to deal with workspaces that maybe useful http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/galeon/utils/gul-x11.c?rev=1.1&view=auto++Created attachment 38253  [details]  [review] patchSorry for getting to this so late in the release cycle, however my geditinstall was a bit brocken (a new instance was always launched, so I didn'tnotice this bug anymore)Note that with the metacity changes this gedit bug has become much more evidentand confusing: now if you have a gedit window open on workspace 1 and youdouble click on a text file in workspace 2, the text file is opened in windowon workspace 1, but the user is left on workspace 2 without even realizing thatthe file has been opened at all.(To clear things up, the behavior with older releases was that the alreadyopened gedit window was moved on the current workspace, which was a bug, butway less confusing).The current behavior is IMHO critical because by note realizing of havingopened the file in another workspace the user may even loose data (open thefile in another editor becase gedit ""doesn't open"" the file, modify, thenswitch workspace and be prompted by gedit to save the file which was in factopened and  by saving overwrite the changes made).The patch implements the proper behavior: if a gedit window is alreadyavailbale in the current workspace, open the file there otherwise opene a newtoplevel window.The patch is not very small but it is pretty simple and the two new functionsused to detect workspaces are cut & pasted by galeon, so are well tested.The patch works well for me, but obviously some more testing is appreciated.Given the above considerations I think that we should ask for inclusion of thispatch (modulo problems in the patch itself) in gedit 2.10.++bumping prio++Comment on attachment 38253  [details]  [review] patchHi, sorry for the late reply but I have a flue. >-			Window getActiveWindow ();>+			Window getActiveWindow (in long workspace); Since the semantic of the function is changed, I think we should try a bettername. >-		bonobo_ui_component_remove_verb (ui_component, verb_name);>+		if (bonobo_ui_component_path_exists (ui_component, path, NULL))>+		{>+			bonobo_ui_component_remove_verb (ui_component, verb_name);> >-		bonobo_ui_component_rm (ui_component, path, NULL);>-		bonobo_ui_component_rm (ui_component, cmd, NULL);>+			bonobo_ui_component_rm (ui_component, path, NULL);>+			bonobo_ui_component_rm (ui_component, cmd, NULL);>+		} Why this change? > > > static GNOME_Gedit_Window> impl_gedit_application_server_getActiveWindow (PortableServer_Servant _servant,>+					       const CORBA_long workspace,> 					       CORBA_Environment * ev) Have you tested this function with sticky windows?

I amrunning sawfish. All the comments talk about the number of workspaces,but I am sure it is also true for the workspace names problem too.1. gnome-settings-daemon seems to listen for any changes to the gconfentry(/desktop/gnome/applications/window_manager/number_of_workspaces) andsets the xatom _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS to that value. This is thenused by sawfish. 2. gnome-settings-daemon is missing the code that initialises_NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS from the gconf value when it starts. I enclosea simple patch to fix this. However this ""fix"" doesn't seem to helpthe problem.3. Whenever sawfish is killed and restarted, if_NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS is not already 1, _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS andthe gconf entry are reset back to 1. I presume it is sawfish doingthis, however I get lost in the lisp code. I have not managed to provethis with strace or ltrace either.4. I managed to get _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS and the entry in gconf tobe different by stopping gnome-settings-daemon (and moving it out ofthe way) and changing the gconf entry with gconf-editor.So I am pretty sure that gnome-settings-daemon is at best acontributory problem. The main problem is that sawfish is resettingthe number of workspaces back to 1 on startup.I will see what else I can find....Damian++Created attachment 10268  [details]  [review] gnome-settings-daemon patch to fix initialisation of wm settings++Adding PATCH keyword.++Hrm.

In Portugese, thisbecomes ""Sem título N"".  When the file chooser is actually invoked, you get thewarnings described in bug #138158 .The problem is that 'fname' above gets passed togtk_file_chooser_set_current_name().  However, as the documentation indicates,the passed string should be in UTF-8, not in filename encoding.  That is, youshould not call g_filename_from_utf8() in gedit-file.c:374.++*** Bug 138158 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++To reproduce this bug:- export LANG=pt_PT.UTF-8- export G_FILENAME_ENCODING=ISO8859-1- gedit- type stuff, hit C-s- see warnings appear++I cannot reproduce it in gedit 2.7.1.Federico: are you still able to reproduce it?++With HEAD as of 2004-07-19:- I don't get warnings from the Save dialog.  The ""Sem título N"" appearscorrectly in the file chooser's name entry.  So, this bug in particular is fixed.- However, after saving, the document's notebook tab says ""Sem t?tulo N (Unicodeinválido)"".  This means that whoever sets the notebook tab's title is screwingup the conversion.Some notes about the last point:gedit-file.c:417 - right after getting the filename from the file chooser, youcall eel_make_uri_from_shell_arg().  This is not necessary for two reasons. First, the file chooser gives you a full filename, which you can simply pass tog_filename_to_uri(); it is not necessary to use _from_shell_arg()'s heuristics. Second, if you really wanted a URI in the first place, you could simply callgtk_file_chooser_get_uri() rather than _get_filename().gedit-file.c:420 - I see that eel_format_uri_for_display() doesn't pay attentionto G_FILENAME_ENCODING, just to the deprecated G_BROKEN_FILENAMES.  See this forreference: http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/glib-running.html#G_FILENAME_ENCODING (I don't know if there's a bug filed for eel about this.)gedit-document.c:659 - This gets called when the GeditDocument emits its""name_changed"" signal after being saved.  This calls eel_uri_get_basename(),which calls gnome_vfs_uri_extract_short_name().  The latter function is uselessbecause you get the unescaped base name, *for which you don't know theencoding*:  you get a raw chunk of bytes.  If it's from a file:// URI, thatchunk of bytes will hopefully be in the charset specified byG_FILENAME_ENCODING; if it comes from a non-file URI, it could be anything, soyou can't really make use of it.A few lines down, in gedit-document.c:663, you try to convert this chunk ofbytes into an UTF-8 base name.  However, you use G_BROKEN_FILENAMES, rather thanG_FILENAME_ENCODING.  You should just use g_filename_to_utf8() instead.  Seethis for reference: http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/glib-Character-Set-Conversion.html#file-name-encodings The culprit for the invalid notebook tab label is gedit-document.c:683, whereyou call eel_make_valid_utf8().RECOMMENDATIONS:The problem you have in gedit is as follows.  You can open any URI, but you canonly save to local files (this makes sense).  However, the code uses a mixtureof raw filenames and URIs, and it doesn't always get the conversions right.You only need to convert filenames to UTF-8 when you want to display thosefilenames.  You should use g_filename_to_utf8() to accomplish that.You only need to convert UTF-8 to a filename when the user types a filename in aGTK+ widget and you want to save that file using Unix calls.  You should useg_filename_from_utf8() for that.To go between filenames and file:// URIs and back, you should useg_filename_to_uri() and g_filename_from_uri().  The latter does not work fornon-file URIs; you should use the gnome-vfs functions instead.++Created attachment 30133  [details]  [review] first small step in the right direction (hopefully)make the file_selector utils return the uri and thus remove theeel_make_uri_from_shell_arg (file) call.++Created attachment 30135  [details]  [review] updatedthere was a blatant mistake in the previous patch.++Comment on attachment 30135  [details]  [review] updated(the above patch was alreday committed a long time ago, some of the problemsare still valid, but they'll probably wayt for the switch to gnome-vfs forsaving)++After the last fixes for bug #166903 and #311187, I think this bug can be closed.federico: please, reopen it if you still see some problems.++Yup, this is fixed now."

Whenever I am posting (and sometimes when replying) to amailing list I have to remember to select the right ""From:"" address. If Iforget the mail can bounce (or I've just increased the spam that goes to mypersonal email address).The solution: Per-folder ""From:"" email addresses (i.e. allow users tochoose a per-folder default account). For example if I am in the folder""evolution"" and either post or reply to a new message my lists@consulting.net.nz email address could be set as the default. A goodplace for the selection item could be a right mouse click on a particularfolder called ""Default Account...""This also has important applications for those taking on roles that use adifferent email address (e.g. responding to queries for a company). Ifthose queries are sorted into separate folders then it will be no longernecessary to select the correct email address when replying to relevantmessages.A useful extension: Per-folder default ""To:"" (and/or CC/BCC) addresses aswell. For example, if you click on the ""evolution"" folder and then click""New Message"" your correct ""From"" address would be filled out and thecorrect ""To"" mailing list address as well! This default would be ignoredwhen replying to a message in the folder instead of posting a new message.Evolution is already a fantastic email client.

The per-folder settingsshould override the per-account settings. Ifpossible the composer should have a ""show customheaders"" option in the ""view"" menu.When composing a new message the settings of thecurrently opened folder should be used.Rationale: I have one IMAP account with a set of folders in which I receive mailfor a number of ""role-accounts"" (noc, news, private, business, severalmailinglists).In such a (common) scenario it makes a lot of sense to be able to to set From:/Cc:/Bcc:/custom headers per folder.There are a lot of people who want this, itregulary comes up on the mailinglists: http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/evolution/2001-May/008736.html  http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/evolution/2001-May/008769.html ++*** bug 257960 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++i dont see the last comment happening.associating a 'default account' with the folder seems quite doable though.++updating version number++Bumping version to a stable release.++*** Bug 564549 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 708741 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++I added the functionality for per-folder and per-recipient send account within commit b5023d3 to git master of evolution (3.11.1+).The setting can be found in Folder Properties and in Edit->Preferences->Composer Preferences->Send Accounts.

taking the time to report this bug.Without a stack trace from the crash it's very hard to determine what caused it.Can you get us a stack trace? Please see http://live.gnome.org/GettingTraces for more information on how to do so. Thanks in advance!This is a mystery. Can you also provide information on your distro, package versions, etc++Here's full trace:(gdb) where full++++Created attachment 102960  [details] strace -ff result++Thanks.Can you please try and isolate which conduit module causes the crash by, one-by-one, removing the module's directory and re-starting conduit.Thanks a lot++Ok, isolated the offending module. It's iPodModule.py and bindings are python-libgpod-0.6.0.++Confusing.So looking at the looks you don't have an iPod connected when this error occurs. So the only code that should execute is equivalent to:import gpodRIGHT_VERSION = gpod.version_info >= (0,6,0)Could you try the following command at a console:python -c ""import gpod; print gpod.version_info""Does it crash? Or does it print a tuple?++It crashes when *quitting* conduit so obviously it returns the right tuple (0, 6, 0). Indeed, confusing. Point me to the right direction and I'll start to dig more into it on my own. I'm a Python programmer for living so I can debug pretty much everything once you tell me what is called when shutting down conduit.++Did you try it though? I *did* see that this happens when you close. The point of the exercise was to see if your python bindings are leaving something in an odd state that crashes python on exit when destroying objects, not to see if the tuple was (0, 6, 0).I'll flesh out my debugging process so you can see im not making wild noobish stabs in the dark.Assumptions: * This is purely the fault of iPodModule.py, and not an interaction with another module (purely to keep it simple for now) * You have no iPod connected (the logs suggested that no iPod was detected, but maybe conduit isn't logging that properly). * In this case, we look at iPodModule.py and see that there are various classes based on IPodBase. These are not instanced or even touched unless an iPod is connected.  * iPodFactory will be instanced, but this won't do anything unless an iPod is connected. This is detected using HAL and several other modules would likely cause this crash too if it was faulty. * The only other code left in the file that means Johns external libraries test are the two lines i posted..If it doesn't crash from this alone then the ""no ipod"" assumption was wrong or libgpod is reacting badly to something else. You didnt correct my ""no ipod"" assumption and im not sure if you actually tried the command i posted, so can you update me before we start looking further into this.++Soory if I sounded a bit aggressive. I did try that line and it works as expected with no crash. There was no iPod connected. I use libgpod bindings in my own Python code and am so far unable to come with a simplified crasher example (that would allow me to file a bug against libgpod) :/++Okie dokie. Lets see if its a gtk interaction.. If you run ./conduit -c in a terminal (not sure it will work in a tty) then conduit will start without its UI. Press Ctrl+C and it will shut down gracefully. It should still do the Uninitializing step that precedes the crasher, but does it crash if the GTK isn't running?(I'm hoping it still crashes)Still crashes? What about interactions with other plugins: Carry on removing plugins from the modules/ until only iPodModule.py is left and see if the crash still happens. Actually, It might be better to remove everything but iPodModule and if the crash goes away, readd modules until the crash comes back..Good luck!++Command line version crashes as well.I've been able to narrow the crashing set to these:[root@purrr modules]# ls__init__.py   __init__.pyo   iPodModule.pyc  N800Module__init__.pyc  iPodModule.py  iPodModule.pyo++I fear it maybe the VolumeMonitor code - not liking two versions at the same time. Which works just fine on Gutsy and Hardy :-(Here is a test case... I'm not sure where this will need to be to work on your setup, for me i put it at the root of an SVN checkout.import conduitimport conduit.modules.N800Module.N800Module as Nimport conduit.modules.iPodModule as If1 = N.N800Factory()f2 = I.iPodFactory()f1.quit()f2.quit()Does this trigger the crash?++Bingo:[patrys@purrr conduit-0.3.5]$ LC_ALL=C python foo.py python: Modules/gcmodule.c:276: visit_decref: Assertion `gc->gc.gc_refs != 0' failed.74d99499-b343-6d63-10b66b37-0e05dc4f is dumped(bug-buddy:26304): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_text_buffer_emit_insert: assertion `g_utf8_validate (text, len, NULL)' failedDoes debian sport any special patches?

I'm certain its because gnomevfs will get hooked to twice, but why has it only hit you? So i have a few work arounds in my mind, but the question is: have we found a python / GnomeVFS bug, or are we just lucky it doesn't crash everywhere? If its their bug i'd rather fix there than here...John S, thoughts? Singleton/Borg pattern in Vfs.py is one option..++Any more thoughts on this? I am still unable to reproduce. Can anyone else reproduce this?++(In reply to comment #19 ) > Any more thoughts on this? I am still unable to reproduce. Can anyone else> reproduce this?> I can pretty much reproduce it 100% with a build for Fedora 8: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=428838++I'm sure its because we touch GnomeVFS twice from two different places - so the bindings aren't dealing with the python GC properly. Can someone with the problem confirm if this python code is enough to trigger the crash?import gnomevfsclass Test(object):    def __init__(self):        self.vm = gnomevfs.VolumeMonitor()        self.vm.connect(""volume-mounted"",self._mounted_cb)        self.vm.connect(""volume-unmounted"",self._unmounted_cb)    def _mounted_cb(self, *args, **kwargs):        pass    def _unmounted_cb(self, *args, **kwargs):        passt1 = Test()t2 = Test()It should either just exit, or possibly segfault..++John:[patrys@purrr Desktop]$ LC_ALL=C python foo.py python: Modules/gcmodule.c:276: visit_decref: Assertion `gc->gc.gc_refs != 0' failed.Aborted.++Thanks for the quick response! I think thats a pretty convincing argument that this is a bug in python gnomevfs...Can you get the source for your distros gnome-python? Where would i be able to get hold of it? Specifically i want to compare this file to your distros (and the same file in ubuntu...) http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gnome-python/trunk/gnomevfs/vfs-volume-monitor.c++Ubuntu Gutsy has same vfs-volume-monitor.c as GNOME SVN++We use unpatched 2.20.1, the file is identical to SVN.++Hmm. Odd. I am verrrry confused..Is this enough to trigger it?import gnomevfst1 = gnomevfs.VolumeMonitor()t2 = gnomevfs.VolumeMonitor()++No, this works fine (clean exit).++So its GnomeVFS with multiple callbacks, or GnomeVFS when wrapped in another object and instanced multiple times.. What about:def _(*args, **kwargs):    passimport gnomevfst1 = gnomevfs.VolumeMonitor()t1.connect(""volume-mounted"",_)t2 = gnomevfs.VolumeMonitor()t2.connect(""volume-mounted"",_)++This crashes as (un)expected.++okie dokie, i'll have a good look through the gnome-python stuff when i get home++John, can you make the gnome-python devs aware of this?++Is this bug still present in 0.3.8?  And if so, is there any simple workaround to keep it from crashing?++John, Any news? Did you ping the gnome-python devs?Unfortunately I think this is a bit of a dead end, GIO is here now, I expect python-gnomevfs to go into the abyss++Also see: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=429970  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=428838++Still a problem with 0.3.11.1 . The bizarre thing is, if I run conduit uninstalled, it crashes on exit; if I run it installed, it crashes on startup (the GUI is never displayed at all).++Is this in Fedora 9, or another distro?++This problem has been fixed in the development version.

There are two caseswhere we use the snapshot service: * From EphyAboutHandler. Here we pass the a time taken from   EphyHistoryService for the mtime. This check does not seem useful in   this case, because it is only a query: it can never result in a new   snapshot being taken to replace the old snapshot. * From EphyWebView itself, when a new page is loaded (or, until   recently, when a favicon was acquired for that page). This is the   only case in which a new snapshot can ever be taken (or updated). In   this case, we pass the current time for mtime, then the comparison   current_time - mtime <= SNAPSHOT_UPDATE_THRESHOLD is the same as   if (0 <= SNAPSHOT_UPDATE_THRESHOLD), and so the snapshots always pass   the check and are never expired.Ideally we would reimplement this properly, since one week seems like agood amount of time for which to persist snapshots. But this is far fromstraightforward to do. For now, let's just remove this code, causingsnapshots to be updated at most once per browsing session.This mitigates the bug where, until recently, we would take snapshots ofcompletely white web views, before the pages had rendered; even thoughwe no longer take white snapshots, broken snapshots that were takenpreviously currently persist forever until ~/.cache/thumbnails iscleared somehow (e.g. by gnome-settings-daemon's housekeeping plugin).Now they will be cleared much sooner.++Nope, that's not enough; clearly it just removes a check that was always met anyway. It just happened that the first site I tested it on got a snapshot update by chance. :(++https://build.webkit.org/dashboard/ is an awesome test page for this; you can change the ports that appear on the dashboard to make obvious changes to the page, to check if the snapshot is updated in the overview.++Created attachment 324985  [details]  [review] snapshot-service: Take new snapshots after a restartThe previous commit was correct, but the commit message was not. Itstated that removing the erroneous check would cause snapshots to betaken if the stored snapshot is too old. In fact, removing the check didnot affect behavior at all -- the check was useless -- and so that didnothing to fix our stale snapshot issue.If the snapshot path is not in memory cache, this is an indication thatthe snapshot is relatively stale (older than the current browsingsession) and should be taken again. But we cannot use the existingsnapshot path memory cache as-is, because it is populated not whensnapshots are taken, but when snapshots are looked up. Augment the cacheto remember which paths were snapshotted since Epiphany was lastrestarted, and check it to determine whether we're due for a snapshot ofthe current page. Also, remove use of the cache from EphyWebView, sincethat would prevent snapshots from ever being taken.This really fixes the issue.++(In reply to Michael Catanzaro from comment #6 ) > Also, remove use of the cache from EphyWebView, since> that would prevent snapshots from ever being taken.

We need to show the old snapshot rather than display a placeholder when this happens. This is an old bug, but it used to be extremely rare; unfortunately it's become obvious now that snapshots are refreshed regularly.++Well that was a good guess, and we should probably do that anyway, but not the problem I'm seeing.

Still investigating.++(In reply to Michael Catanzaro from comment #10 ) > so the file's mtime is 13 milliseconds older than the mtime embedded in the PNG Ah, it's note the mtime of the file, it's the mtime of when we saved the page in history, from the history service, which of course can be a bit off of the actual mtime saved by gnome-desktop. We never noticed before because the snapshots were never refreshed ever, so once it worked once for a particular page, then that page would be good forever. But now it can break at any time. Since gnome-desktop requires we pass the EXACT mtime, because it expects us to be thumbnailing files on disk, it's hard to think of what to do about this, except adding API to gnome-desktop to avoid the mtime check (since we don't want that in Epiphany, it just gets in our way). This is quite unfortunate. Possibly would be better to bite the bullet and copy the portion of the code we need out of gnome-desktop; Epiphany is not a thumbnailer, after all.++Ugh, wrong again; sorry for the unnecessary CCs. Maybe I need some waiting period between thinking and posting a comment on Bugzilla. :) There is never any comparison to the actual mtime on disk, only to the mtime embedded in the PNG, which is controlled by Epiphany. The problem is that we just pass the current time when saving the snapshot; instead we just need to pass the time saved in history.

No, it can never happen as the snapshot service is currently used; something will always be loaded in the web view before this function is called, and webkit_web_view_get_uri is documented to only return NULL if nothing has ever been loaded. The return value is not nullable, but that's a WebKit bug (see #152826).But I think that as currently-written, it kinda makes sense for the snapshot service to handle this case; it's currently very generic and has public interface to support many operations that Epiphany never uses.

135201,gtk+,Widget: Other,Make it harder to accidently start multiple Yelp instances,"A friend suggested ""Don't spawn gnome-helps indefinately if f1 is pressed;having a bookfall onto your keyboard renders your machine useless for a_long_ time.""This is not an unreasonable idea, since Yelp is a rare application that canbe started with a single keystroke (and hence accidently). So maybe weshould only spawn a single instance of Yelp and just bring it to theforeground if <F1> is pressed whilst Yelp is running.I had a couple of other crazy ideas about how to handle this based ondialog boxes popping up requesting confirmation (and behaving differentlyif the dialog box was already showing), but they seem to have usabilityproblems.A big problem here is how to implement this in such a way that we never endup in a deadlocked state.++Yelp already does only use a single process, using bonobo activation. If Yelp is called when there's already a running process, thatprocess is just told to open a new window.  I certainly do not want tochange the behavior to bringing an existing window to the foregroundto load the contents.I think this is an issue best solved at the GTK+/libgnomeui level, bysomehow suppressing insanely rapid refires of that shortcut.++*** Bug 169160 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++Shaun is right here.  I tried to implement some logic to refuse to create a new window if yelp is spawned multiple times in a short period of time.The problem is that every time you press F1, it starts a new yelp process and generates load on the machine.  If you hold down F1, it continuously spawns yelp processes and it takes successively longer and longer to start each yelp process.  The result is that by the time the Bonobo component in the original process receives the request to create the new window, the time duration has elapsed and it ends up spawning a new window.++Since most every program uses the gnome_help_display* family of API calls to open the help system, it makes sense that this be implemented at the libgnome level.++Isn't this best handled at the keyboard shortcut level? For example not trigger until key release or something like that?++This is still an issue even though everyone is moving away from gnome_help* and use gtk_show_uri instead. Where do we move this bug? gtk+?++Yes.++this problem has been solved by making yelp single-instance."

Observe in the terminal window that the gedit starts allocating more and morememory with a high rate of pages per second.7. Observe that bringing the cursor back to the first line which is in English,the memory consumption stops.Well, my experience shows that the longer the paragraph, the faster the memoryconsumption.

135209,gnopernicus,srcore,caret is not followed after a text-change:delete event,"After a 'text-changed:delete' event, gnopernicus doesn't follow the caret.++When gnopernicus reports an event for a text object, it retains someinformation (last cursor position, the number of characters, etc).These information are used to filter events for that object. In caseof gtk apps, when the text-changed:delete event is received, thenumber of characters has the old value (before deleting). Retainingthis value when other events are received, them can be rejectedbecause wrong values were retained when prevous event was reported andthe entire filtering process has bad input values.In case of Java apps, when the text-changed:delete is received, allinformation have the actual value (the number of caracters doesn'tinclude the length of deleted text).++remus: you can fix the 'retained' value by using the info from thetext-changed event instead of querying the AccessibleText interfacefor the 'current' information.  I think the filtering logic needsrevision.Can you point us to the gnopernicus code that does the filteringlogic?  I am wondering if it can be made more efficient (sounds likelots of API calls are being made for event filtering and/or inresponse to these text-changed events, and perhaps they are not allnecessary).++Created attachment 25159  [details] output for gedit++Created attachment 25160  [details] output dor SO++Both logs were obtained using same scenario: 1. type 1, 2, 3, 4 2. press left arrow key 2 times 3. press DELETE key 4. press BACKSPACE key 5. press DELETE key 6. press BACKSPACE keyFor every ""object:text-changed:delete"" event value for character countcannot be obtained using same formula for both toolkits.In gtk+, the value can be obtained with:AccessibleText_getCharacterCount() - event.detail2.In java, the value can be obtained with:AccessibleText_getCharacterCount().So, using only event details is not a reliable solution.++Padraig - do you have enough information from the Java layer tosynthesize the appropriate information in event.detail2 so thatGnopernicus can use the same algorythm in Java as it does in GTK+?  Ifnot, we need to know ASAP, as there is very little time to makechanges in the forthcoming release of the Java platform!++I could set detail2 to zero in the Java Access Bridge which looks likeit would work for Remus.I am not convinced that that is the correct solution. detail2 issupposed to be the number of characters deleted.Should we consider trying to have the ""text-changed:delete"" eventemitted after the text has been updated? It looks like this would haveto be done in the atk-bridge and may be non-trivial.++The issue is not in event.detail2 - that's not where the necessaryinfo needs to be (though detail1 and detail2 *do* need to match theAPI).  What gnopernicus needs is the extra marshalled info in theCORBA_Any struct associated with text-changed events, which is thendemarshalled by AccessibleTextChangeEvent_getChangeString (event).++Remus: your algorithm is flawed - as you point out, you cannot usethis method for determining the length of a text string.AccessibleText_getCharacterCount() will always return the ""correct""value, and the text-changed events will tell you about the changes,but we make no guarantees abou the relation between the two calls/events.If you want to keep a local character-count or cache current bylistening to text-changed events, you must do it this way:* when you decide to monitor a Text object, you either cache itscontents, or store its length.  You might do this for instance if youare cacheing the ""currently focussed text object"" - when you get afocus event from a text object, you call getCharacterCount() and/orgetText():    current_text_len = AccessibleText_getCharacterCount (text);* when you receive text-changed events from this object, you canadjust the character count    current_text_len -= event.detail2* you could even keep cached text content ""current"", with->  on focus:  text_cache = g_strdup (AccessibleText_getText (text));->  on text-changed:delete :          prefix = g_strndup (text_cache, event.detail1);         suffix = g_strdup (text_cache + event.detail1 + event.detail2);        tmp_text = g_strconcat (prefix, suffix, NULL);and you could let the user know, if you like, that the followingstring was deleted:        deleted = AccessibleTextChangeEvent_getChangeString (event);(I have omitted error checking and necessary string-freeing calls -for instance you would want to use SPI_freeString on getText above)++The code:  text_cache = g_strdup (AccessibleText_getText (text));may be unwise.  It is legal for the text to be very large (hundreds ofkilobytes long).  It would make more sense to cache the text aroundthe caret location.Otherwise, I completely agree with Bill's spoints - you cannot assumethe state of the text when you get the delete event.++I agree with Peter - please don't copy my example directly :-)it was only an illustration, of course, and doesn't do error checking,bounds checking, or free things properly.You could cache the 'current line' of text, for instance, or as Petersuggests you could pick some 'maximum' length to store.++Bill, your solution  ""current_text_len -= event.detail2"" will workonly if event.details2 will be set to ""0"" for Java as Padraigmentioned. Now, this parameter has the value of the index of firstcharacter after the deleted text.++Remus:   ""Bill, your solution  ""current_text_len -= event.detail2"" will work   only if event.details2 will be set to ""0"" for Java as Padraig   mentioned.""I do not agree.

It is not moved.If the appointment spans the Last day, then the Last Day is shown empty,the middle-of-appointment entry is elided and not moved.I suspect this is an off-by-one error when passing data for display.The appointment is recognised correctly as single-day.The appointment is passed incorrectly for display to the wrong day.The day-display routine sees that the end-day of the appointment is laterthan the day it's been wrongly given, so it starts to display a multi-dayappointment.As far as I can tell, this accounts for the behaviour of thebug for single appointments and the start of multi-day appointments.

559404,gtk+,Widget: GtkEntry,gtk_editable_insert_text counts length in bytes,"While testing text editing inspired by bug 143956 , I noticed that gtk_editable_insert_text doesn't work with UTF-8 like one would expect.The new_text_length argument is supposed to take the length of the string. Since Gtk is normally using and enforcing UTF-8 everywhere and it isn't documented otherwise, one would expect it to be ""length of the text in characters"". But in fact it is the length in bytes and GtkEntry is relying on that.Since we can hardly change the meaning of that argument anymore, I suggest to at least document it properly.++Created attachment 122007  [details]  [review] A test case with latin and unicode stringsThis is the test case I wrote that demonstrates how inserting a string breaks if one assumes new_text_length to be the length in characters.++Created attachment 122009  [details]  [review] Document new_text_length as the number of bytes++Created attachment 122017  [details]  [review] Document new_text_length as the number of bytes, reworded++Owen was so kind as to resolve my confusion. For one thing, Gtk+ assumes NULL to be nothing else but the end of a string, and embeded NULLs are not supported at all. Further more the raison why GtkEditable positions are counted in characters rather than bytes is merely the lack of a more sophisticated interface that would allow for iterating over text. At the end of the day clearly it makes string handling significantly easier to assume that strings are NULL terminated except for sub strings without any NULL characters.2008-11-05  Christian Dywan  < christian@imendio.com > Bug 559404 – gtk_editable_insert_text counts length in bytes	* gtk/gtkeditable.c:	Document new_text_length as the number of bytes"

I'm working on a patch to fix this for HEAD so that yelp understands UTF-8.  However, it is not going to respect the character set specified by the LC_* variables.  Instead, it has an language -> encoding mapping hardcoded, so that for example any files in /usr/share/man/fr/ would be converted to UTF-8 from ISO-8859-1The crux of the problem is that there is no standard marking that tells you what encoding a man page is in.  So we just guess based on the path.++Created attachment 66414  [details]  [review] rather large and intrusive patch to support translated man pagesThis patch does a couple of things:1) Changes most of the major bits in yelp-man-parser.c to support UTF-82) Fixes TOC code in yelp-toc-pager.c so that the language of a particular man page is stored3) Indicates the main language the user was running when the cache file ~/.gnome2/yelp.d/manindex.xml was created, as an attribute to the root element, as well as indicating the language for each <dir> element4) Perform the necessary encoding conversion to UTF-8, from the encoding of the manual page.5) few miscellaneous bug fixesFor people that want to test a different language, simply invoke yelp with LANGUAGE=""<locale>"" $prefix/bin/yelpThe cache file will get recreated and any man pages present for that locale should appear in their translated form when clicked on through the TOC.++Additionally, if you are specifying an absolute path to a man page, then it is recommended to set the MAN_ENCODING environment variable as follows:MAN_ENCODING=""EUC-JP"" /opt/gnome2/bin/yelp man:/usr/share/man/ja/man1/su.1.gzI am considering putting in code to parse the path to determine the language (ja) and encoding (EUC-JP) for the man page.++Thanks Brent for caring about non english speaking users and reacting so quickly !

399529,metacity,general,apps requesting huge windows cause BadAlloc in metacity,"The attached program crashes metacity for me. You might want to experiment with height and width in it to get the crash-effect.++Created attachment 80920  [details] kill metacity in 5 easy steps++Created attachment 80945  [details]  [review] Stop this killing metacityWhat's happening here is a bug in gdk, I suppose. If you try to call gdk_window_begin_paint_rect with an insanely huge rectangle, it dies with BadAlloc, as you know from your own program; since metacity uses gtk to paint the windows, it itself will attempt to call gdk_window_begin_paint_rect with an insanely huge rectangle, and die with BadAlloc in the process. (You'll need to set METACITY_SYNC=1 to see this.) That's why other WMs don't have a problem here: they don't use gdk.So, what can we do about it? I don't know. The attached is a patch to make metacity complain and not decorate the window if it can't do so because of an X error when calling gdk_window_begin_paint_rect. I don't know whether this is the best solution. Elijah, Havoc, others-- any thoughts?++s/paint the windows/decorate the windows/, you know what I meant.++One possible fix would be to clip the painting to the screen extents (there is a race condition here - the window could move in relation to the screen while drawing - maybe one fix for that would be to clip to a bit larger area than the screen, and skip the clipping for windows smaller than the screen, so only large windows that get moved a lot would repaint incorrectly)I think metacity might already draw the frame as four stripes on the four sides instead of one big rect, which was also a past attempt to fix this bug if so...++Created attachment 81243  [details]  [review] Clamp the rectangle to an area slightly larger than the screenGood plan. So, here's a patch which clamps the rectangle values not to stray >200px outside the edges of the screen.While I was working on that, I noticed that we carry out all these calculations for every drawable and then throw them away 1/3 of the time when GDK_IS_WINDOW is false. I refactored the code a little bit to only do these calculations when GDK_IS_WINDOW is true.Results: The kill.py program no longer kills metacity. Also, window decoration is slightly faster (about 0.1ms for a small simple window, but it all adds up).Without the patch, metacity-theme-viewer says:Drew 100 frames in 0.07 client-side seconds (0.7 milliseconds per frame) and 0.493933 seconds wall clock time including X server resources (4.93933 milliseconds per frame)With the patch:Drew 100 frames in 0.08 client-side seconds (0.8 milliseconds per frame) and 0.486864 seconds wall clock time including X server resources (4.86864 milliseconds per frame)++I haven't looked very closely at the patch, but considering the source and the long list of patches needing review...  :)++Great, thanks.

Attached is what I came up with.  It's basically the same as your patch, just a bit more terse and with a few extra comments here and there.My main question is basically: wouldn't it be better/more efficient to sort the list by offset+size rather than just offset?  Otherwise we might stop looking for cached content in the list too early, no?As for caching the list of typefinders: it would probably be best to file a separate enhancement bug for this.  It looks like an okay thing to do in general, but it probably needs some more work to take into account registry rescans (and locking ?) and freeing resources on gst_deinit() IMO.++Yes sorting by offset+size makes sense. Can we somehow incrementaly commit this? I don't care based on which patch we continue.++Hmm, instead of sorting by offset and then size, shouldn't we just keep the largest and kick out smaller ones?++> Hmm, instead of sorting by offset and then size, shouldn't we just keep the> largest and kick out smaller ones?

459697,tomboy,General,license confusion,"README states that Tomboy is licensed under the LGPL, and COPYING confirms that.However, several of the files shipped in libtomboy/ have a GPL license notice.++You're right...these are taken from gedit's print code.  Thank you for pointing this out.We've been planning to rewrite the printing code at some point, but there is no way this will be done by the next stable release.  I wonder if the authors of those files would be willing to grant LGPL rights to us...Confirming with high priority, major severity, though in reality this should probably be a blocker.  I'll ask around.++I don't know what to do about the fact that Chema Celorio is listed as having copyright on these files.  I think I'm going to need some help.++Print functionality is provided by an addin that compiles into its own assembly.  Would there be anything wrong with moving the offending files into a separate library used only by the print addin, if the print addin was distributed under the GPL?In this case the print addin (GPL) would link in libraries Tomboy.exe (LGPL) and libtomboyprint (GPL).  At runtime, Tomboy.exe discovers the print addin and calls it using interfaces defined in Tomboy.exe.After reading http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLAndPlugins , it seems like this is a ""borderline"" case, because Tomboy.exe (LGPL) does not make calls into the print addin (GPL) that are *defined* in the print addin.++Another small notice: Tomboy/panelapplet/PanelAppletFactory.cs states that itis under LGPL v2 (without the usual ""or later"" clause)++Quick update on the original license issue: I discussed this with Luis Villa and others, and have come to the conclusion that the best solution for now is to pull the print code out into its own C library (libtomboyprint, for example), only link it to the print addin, and distribute that addin along with libtomboyprint under the GPL.  This puts us in the borderline situation of having an LGPL application with a GPL plugin/addin, but I feel this is OK as long as we make a priority of rewriting the print code.I'll look into the other situation.  :-)  Thanks for helping!++I've moved the GPL code into the Tomboy/Addins/PrintNotes/ directory which now creates a libprintnotes.  Also, I've modified the COPYING file to mention the exception.  A GPL license has been included in Tomboy/Addins/PrintNotes/COPYING as well.This is all committed in r1467 & r1468."

However, there is anissue with rendering which I hope somebody can help me with. Firstly the code is based off how Epiphany does drap-n-drop of tabs. There is anew widget, TerminalNotebook, which inherits from GtkNotebook. TerminalNotebookadds support for detecting when a tab is being dragged and moved.In order to support moving of tabs between terminal windows I've had to turnTerminalScreen into a GtkWidget. Now instead of putting a GtkHBox containing aVTE widget and a scrollbar into the notebook widget, a TerminalScreen widget isadded directly into the notebook widget. This way moving a tab between terminalwindows is a matter of removing the TerminalScreen widget from one notebook andadding it to another notebook.Now the problem I'm having is that TerminalScreen widgets which are not visibleare not resized when the terminal window is resized. That is, the TerminalScreenwidget which is visible is resized however all the TerminalScreen widgets in theother tabs are not resized.The most notable affect of this is that when you open up more than on tab.Switching back to the first tab will show the TerminalScreen widget has not beenresized to accommodate for the tabs along the top of the window. I'll attach ascreenshot.Anyway, the patch is against gnome-terminal 2.10.0.

There are two possibilities, either it is checked or not.a) If one has it checked, then it did what it says, without any difference between Sent folders and other folders. This patch adds two global settings, one for regular folders, the other for all sent/drafts/outbox folders.b) if the above option is unchecked, then each folder has its own view set. And the behaviour of the non-default Sent folder view depends whether it was selected before it was set to a sent folder or not. If it wasn't then the new view is remembered from the default view, which is always the one for Sent folder, but if user was in the folder already, then the previously saved view is used, regardless of the default view. In other words, what you were seeing was, from my point of view, behaving like you would intentionally change the view to other than ""As Sent"".++Created commit 5989073 in evo master (2.91.92+)"

I need to file a bug against bugzilla.gnome.org for submitting abug upon hitting enter when in the summary field instead of moving tothe description field...  Sorry about that.I'm just learning gtk+, and I came across a problem where I couldn'tget a window showing a progress bar to display.  I tried for a longtime to solve this problem, and eventually via searching thegnome-app-devel list archives, I ran across this email: http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-list/1999-October/msg00505.html Which supposedly refers to this question from the FAQ http://www.gtk.org/faq/#AEN531 As one can gather from reading that and the follow up post: http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-list/1999-October/msg00524.html the FAQ is no longer the same as it use to be.  I tried reading therest of the thread, but it didn't have the information I needed.  Isearched the rest of the FAQ for the original question but I could notfind it anywhere.  Is there any way that the original question andanswer could be added to the FAQ?Thanks!++This one, I expect. http://www.gtk.org/faq/#AEN566++That's possible, but if so it changed.  The original email thread saysthat the FAQ said to somehow use the following code snippet:   while (gtk_events_pending())     gtk_main_iteration();While the link you gave says to use   while (g_main_iteration(FALSE));I'm not entirely sure what the difference is, and it brings up anotherquestion.  So, my questions:  1) Why g_main_iteration when the link http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/glib-The-Main-Event-Loop.html#g-main-iteration claims that the function is deprecated?  2) Other than blocking vs. nonblocking, what the difference between     Glib's g_main_iteration and Gtk's gtk_main_iteration?++Which one to use is dependent upon which version of GTK you are using.All the variants listed are correct within the context of the GTKversion being discussed.The function was 'moved' from gtk to glib hence the change fromgtk_main_iteration to g_main_iteration.I don't remember precisely which GTK version each is valid for, but itgoes something like:GTK 1.0: gtk_main_iterationGTK 1.2: g_main_iterationGTK 2.x: g_main_context_iteration(not sure when g_main_iteration was deprecated)I've updated the FAQ in CVS HEAD to g_main_context_iteration(will copy over to CVS 2.2 when I do an update of that)"

Although Ibelieve it would be possible for us to create a page especially for quick entryof GIMP bugs, I'm not quite sure what it would look like.Would you like to do a mock-up of what such a page should look like? Andrew orLuis might have opinions on whether/how it should be integrated into Bugzilla,though.Cheers,Dave.++So when you view bugs, you want the ""New bug"" link just to submit a bug for thelast queried product.We can't do that; it just doesn't work with everyone else using bugzilla acrossmultiple products. Sorry.++Hi Andrew,I understood differently - I understood that the original poster wanted to havea direct link on the GIMP web-page which allowed him to bypass the stockbugzilla bug entry page, and enter a bug directly against the GIMP - thereporter would then just select the component, perhaps version, and add a comment.Now that I've looked at it, this is possible as-is, by linking directly into http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GIMP Re-opening, and requesting that a link to this be added to the gimp.org website.Dave.++Oops - seemed like I did misinterpret things. And I forgot to reassign the bug.Adding a link to have a bug reported against the GIMP on www.gimp.org is still agood idea, so leaving this open (and reassigning). I agree with Andrew thathaving the ""New bug"" link at the bottom of the query page be related to the lastquery is an unworkable idea in general.Cheers,Dave.++Ah, punaise. Resolving again, since I just checked the gimp.org bugs page, andthere is a link direct to http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GIMP called ""Submit a bug!"".Dave.++> I understood that the original poster wanted to have a direct link on the GIMP web-pageSorry !

I missed that link on the gimp pages. > which allowed him to bypass the stock bugzilla bug entry page, and enter a bug directly against the GIMP - thereporter would then just select the component, perhaps version, and add a comment.I meantwhen listing bugs for a specific product(eg: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi ?product=GIMP&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED)I think the 'Enter new bug' at the bottom at the page should link to a page that is specific to the current product ( http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GIMP ) and not generic ( http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi ) When you're listing gimp bugs I think you want to report gimp bugs, don't you ? So I don't want these extra-step to choose the app   (perhaps should we propose two linksEnter new bug for GIMPEnter new bug in Bugzilla)++I am reopening this bug now that we have a better description of the problem.Re-assigning to bugzilla.gnome.org because this is not something that can befixed on www.gimp.org.I doubt that implementing this enhancement would be trivial, though...++I've already said I really don't think this is worth it.

I know bugzilla is a BTS (bug tracking service ?) for a lot of products. But when you start listing bugs for a specific application (gimp) I think you want to report bugs for THAT application : you don't start browsing DOXYGEN bugs before reporting a bug for gimp, do you ?on gimp.org (and I suppose on most sites concerned by bugzilla) there are some links for closed, opened, recent, old (...) bugs. When I follow those links I got the info needed. fine ! But when I hit the ""Add new bug"" at the bottom of the list I DO expect to report a bug for gimp !If I want to report a bug for another application I would hit the bugzilla button that will ask me which app I want to declare a bug on.90% of the time the bug will concern the current app you are browsing list for (usual) (10% for others gtk, gnome ...)(exception) > I doubt that implementing this enhancement would be trivial, though... IMO it would be. It's only a question of parsing the querystring for the ""PRODUCT"" and to add it to the link (?PRODUCT=the_value_that_was_in_the_querystring)Or we can add a new button, if we want 2 buttons : a ""Add new bug for #product name#"" and ""Add new bug for another application"")++I don't think there's any misunderstanding. It would perhaps be a significanteffort to do what you're asking (it might also be easy, I haven't really thoughtabout it), so the benefit of the result is probably not worth the effort itwould take.You would have to detect whether only one product was represented in the list ofbugs, and add product= on the link for ""Add a new bug to $PRODUCT"" link. Youwould also expect that to do the same if you were going back to a previouslyrequested link, which (to me) implies not just getting the product strings fromthe GET, but actually looking at the list of bugs requested.But then say I look for bugs with ""palette"" in the description (withoutselecting a particular product), and I get just GIMP bugs back, should I stillhave ""Create a new bug for GIMP""?There are a fair number of fringe cases to think about. Perhaps if you were topropose a patch?++Yes, if a patch was proposed we'd definitely consider it.( but if you're working on this I think you should try to get a patch inupstream as well )++Sorry no real patch to offer but that is what I thought aboutin buglist.cgi: (I don't know what is really behind (perl ? C ?) so I will do it in pseudo-code.I Hope you'll understand)this example is for the ""two buttons"" version...<a href=""enter_bug.cgi"">Enter New Bug in Bugzilla</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;...<? if (querystring[""PRODUCT""] != null) echo ""<a href='enter_bug.cgi?PRODUCT="" + querystring[""PRODUCT""] + ""'>Enter a new Bug for "" + querystring[""PRODUCT""] +""</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;"" ;  ?> ... > You would have to detect whether only one product was represented in the list of bugsthis is not what I asked for (I know I could be unclear about that). I just thought about making a new specific link to the PRODUCT (if and only if there is one in the querystring) > But then say I look for bugs with ""palette"" in the description (without selecting a particular product), and I get just GIMP bugs back, should I stillhave ""Create a new bug for GIMP""?when I search for palette accross all apps I use this URL http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi ?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&field0-0-0=product&type0-0-0=substring&value0-0-0=palette&field0-0-1=component&type0-0-1=substring&value0-0-1=palette&field0-0-2=short_desc&type0-0-2=substring&value0-0-2=palette&field0-0-3=status_whiteboard&type0-0-3=substring&value0-0-3=paletteWe see there's no PRODUCT in the querystring so no need for a special button on gimp (but why not ? if all responses talk about the gimp it could be nice to ""suggest"" it to the user but I could live without and this is way more complicated that my suggestion)On the opposite, all links on http://www.gimp.org/bugs/ started with ?PRODUCT=Gimp so there will be the two buttons at the bottom of each list. > You would also expect that to do the same if you were going back to a previously requested link, Not 100% sure of what we're talking about. What do you mean by ""going back to a previously requested link"" (navigating browser's history ?). > which (to me) implies not just getting the product strings from the GET, but actually looking at the list of bugs requested.Not 100% sure of what we're talking about. But I can't see why the product would ""disappear"". If the product was in the GET string the ""first time"" it will still be there the Nth times (if there's no product in the Nth request, then Nth request != 1st request)++Hi Vincent,There are a number of problems with the approach you propose - first, if youquery bugs for more than one product, you arrive in buglist with?product=gtk+&product=glib (for example). Second (here is what I meant byproduct not being in the query the second time), if you follow a link of one ofthe bugs in your list, and then follow the link to reget your list, the URL is http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?regetlastlist=1 and you don't have the""Enter bug against the GIMP"" at the bottom.So you would have to check that there was only one product specified on thequery string at least (which would have limited usefulness, but would besomewhat useful), or alternatively (as I said) check that all the bugs in thelist come from the same product.I hope this clears up the confusion over the fringe cases I was pointing out.++Created attachment 29904  [details]  [review] Patch to buglist.cgiI've done up a patch to do the guts of this (there are a few things around thatneed changing, but this more or less works, I think). I agree with Andrew thatwe should see if this kind of thing interests bugzilla and get it into the nextversion (2.19 I guess).Attaching as diffs to buglist.cgi and template/en/list/list.html.tmpl. The restshould be fairly obvious...++Created attachment 29905  [details]  [review] Patch to list.html.tmplThe basic idea is to mabe bugproducts not depend on dotweak, so that we can useit for a specific product.++> first, if you query bugs for more than one product, you arrive in buglist with?product=gtk+&product=glib (for example). OK. That's what I didn't understand. The way I used bugzilla I only queried one product at a time. For my information could you precise how (which url) do you query 2+ products at a time ? > if you follow a link of one of the bugs in your list, and then follow the link to reget your list, the URL is http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?regetlastlist=1 and you don't have the""Enter bug against the GIMP"" at the bottom.Ok, I didn't catch this one either.With this 2 infos, it definitively looks more complicated that what I thought first and I agree the ratio ""interest/coding time"" should be investigated more deeply.Sorry 4 taking so much of your time.++Perhaps you missed the fact that I attached some patches to do this :)Just to explain the 2 bits you don't understand:1) Go to the bugzilla query page http://bugzilla.gnome.org/query.cgi and in theProduct section, select 2 products (click the first, then control-click asecond). This is a pretty common operation for some people if they are trackinga number of modules that are closely linked.2) Generate a bug list (for example, search for all bugs with 'horse' in thedescription), click on a bug (say bug #147075 - http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147076 ), then at the top and bottom ofthe page you should see ""Bug 2 of 15 in _list_"". If you click on the list link,you get brought back to the same list of bugs as you previously had.I do this an awful lot.Anyway - the change is easy, perhaps Andrew will integrate it, I'd like to seesome comments from the Bugzilla developers first, since I may not be using theright template idioms. The bug is bug #253131 in their bug database: http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=253131 Cheers,Dave.++If I understand your patch well, you plan to add a ""add new bug"" for each product in the querystring. If there are ""too many"" products I think this would be confusing (and screen space consumming).I think a good compromise would be a <select> with the selected products first (alpha sort if possible ?) then a separator then all the products tracked in bugzillaif the query was ?product=Gimp&product=Gtk....the result would be                   - currently selected product(s) -Add a new bug for [Gimp                             ]                   Gtk                   -- all products available -------                   acme                   at-poke                   at-spi++That would be possible, of course, but the patch doesn't do that - it checks [% IF bugproducts.size == 1 %]which means that a link is only added if there is exactly one product in the buglist.Dave.++Hrm. FWIW, I've wanted this for a long time- it's a very common operation, IMHO,to: (1) query for bugs on a product and (2) file a bug if the one you werelooking for was not in the list.Based on upstream comments, I'm going to mark these needs-work, but Dave, if youwant to pursue, I'd be quite grateful.++*** Bug 51683 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=328667++--> fixed.Backported the upstream fix (used 'Enter a new bug' instead of 'Fill a new bug')."

Forsome obscure reason, these images that should be no bigger than half akilobyte, are 8 kB each. At 78 images, that's a bit steep for modem users.78 images are 78 http requests too, which may not be very nice on theserver either.I will attach a few previews I made myself, which are all somewhere between250 and 500 bytes, for demonstration purposes.++Created attachment 18936  [details] example of small abstract_1 file++Created attachment 18937  [details] example of small 'aneurism' gradient preview++Created attachment 18938  [details] example of small 'blinds' gradient preview++Possible solution for the image size problem: PNGCrush. I tested itwith one image and it reduced it quite nicely.++Ouch!  Indeed, that page is much too big.  I tried at home with my33Kb modem and it took a long time for that page to be displayed.I checked some of these images and I saw that they were saved as fullRGB PNG images, and apparently not with the maximum compression.These images are only 64 pixels wide, so they cannot have more than64 colors.Using the GIMP to convert the images to Indexed mode (palette of 64colors) and selecting the maximum compression (9) for PNG reduces thesize of the images to a few hundred bytes, as PNGCrush does.  It ismuch better to save them in indexed mode, and this also avoids someproblems that could occur with some old browsers that can only displayindexed PNG images.++I am afraid I must disagree, but whether the image is indexed or24-bits colour has got nothing to with the huge file sizes in thiscase. As a matter of fact, the test files I saved in 24-bits colorwere generally some 100 bytes smaller than their indexed counterparts.And of course the file PNGCRUSH produces is the smallest possible, so24-bit pp.Although I really don't care, I think it would be silly to forcePNGCRUSH to produce indexed files if the only result would be filesthat are larger than we could have had. Just the default, settinglessPNGCRUSH would do fine.The reason true colour can be more economic than indexed in this caseis probably because the images are relatively small,amount-of-pixel-wise. When that happens, including a palette mayactually make a file larger.As for why these image files are so large I don't know, but I lookedat one of them in an editor, and the iDAT chunk contains some datathat looks like white noise (in other words, compressed), followed bya large amount of zeroes interspersed with twos.Just FYI.++I don't understand.  The GIMP can certainly produce small PNG images.Try this:- open one of the RGB images- select Image->Mode->Indexed- enter 64 in the number of colors- select No Dithering (this is important)- OK- File->Save As...  and select the *.png file- in the PNG options, deselect everything and move the compression  slider to 9.I got rather small files with this technique.  Note that I used 1.2.5.GIMP 1.3.17 may produce larger files because of the image comment.++I replaced the 8+kB gradients with mostly 1-kB ones. (Yes, Raphael,they're 24 bit :-).)

BTW: I'm a gentoo on amd64 user, and the segfault only occurs when there aremore than 2 ""user"" entries in fstab.++examening the code in gnome-vfs-volume-monitor-daemon.c, i found out thatloopback-devices are threated the same way as non-usermountable devices. Soadding loop=/dev/loop1 to your fstab entry options will let nautilus ignore thisentry. This is a nice workaround for now, but something goes wrong when adding thethird removable device to nautilus on amd64 has to be fixed. Sadly, I'm kindanew to linux-command line debugging and don't have any idea how to debug alibrary. If someone could give me some hints, that would be great.++Ok, i spent some time on trying to debug the library. I got as far seeing thelibgnome-vfs sourcecode in ddd. However, it did not halt at the breakpoint i setin the gnome-vfs-volume-monitor-deamon.c file. This has to do with the simplefact that this file is part of a CORBA deamon that gets called from the-client.c file, over CORBA. I tried attaching gdb to this deamon, but thatdidn't work for me. I debugged gnome-vfs-volume-monitor-client.c though. It creates an internal listof drives that it recieved from the CORBA deamon. then it wants to free theCORBA object with ""CORBA_free (list);"". At that point the segfault occurs.++Created attachment 28747  [details]  [review] Patch to fix nautilus crasher on AMD64I just got an AMD64 system this past weekend and was really bummed when I hitthis same bug.	I did some tracing and debugging and discovered the cause.  Itis actually an alignment bug in ORBit2 (in the code behind CORBA_free() asXiPHiaS mentioned).Essentially, gnome-vfs2 requests a list of removable media from the volumemonitor daemon so that it knows what icons to show on the desktop (CD/DVD-ROMdrives, floppy drives, zip drives, etc.).  This takes place through a Corbacall.  The call returns a list of drives and information about the drives in asequence of structures.  The alignment of the structures and their data membersare correct when they are constructed (demarshalled), however when the list ispassed to CORBA_free() to free the memory used by the list, the code that freeseach structure fails to take into account the proper alignment of eachstructure (8 bytes on AMD64).  The result is that after the second item in thelist, a point goes far enough astray to cause it to free() some bogus chunks ofmemory.I made a patch (attached) of a one-liner that should fix this.	I don't thinkits the best way to fix it, but it works.  The fix aligns the pointer properlybefore freeing a structure (within ORBit_freekids_via_TypeCode_T()).diff -Naur ORBit2-2.10.0/src/orb/orb-core/allocators.cORBit2-2.10.0.1-cbl/src/orb/orb-core/allocators.c--- ORBit2-2.10.0/src/orb/orb-core/allocators.c 2003-07-07 13:11:31.000000000+0000+++ ORBit2-2.10.0.1-cbl/src/orb/orb-core/allocators.c	2004-06-1604:11:27.642691407 +0000@@ -59,6 +59,7 @@	}	case CORBA_tk_except:	case CORBA_tk_struct:+		mem = ALIGN_ADDRESS (mem, tc->c_align);		for (i = 0; i < tc->sub_parts; i++) {			subtc = tc->subtypes [i];			mem = ALIGN_ADDRESS (mem, subtc->c_align);++Just tested this on my gentoo box, works a treat.

Yes, the DarkRoom theme for some reason is shipped with the ""Input boxes"" colours set to the traditional black on white. I have been experimenting with this theme and those colours set to a matching light on dark colour pair, and it seems that most of the problems a dark GTK+ theme tends to have no longer exist as long as all colour pairs are set as light on dark.I'm not sure if this should be considered a bug in the theme, or if applications should actively avoid mixing the Style.{BaseColors|TextColors} foreground and Style.{Backgrounds|Foregrounds} background (and vice versa).I've opened a question about this at Ubuntu's Launchpad, as they currently ship the DarkRoom theme like that in the Karmic Beta: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/human-theme/+question/84249++Bulk changing the assignee to banshee-maint@gnome.bugs to make it easier for people to get updated on all banshee bugs by following that address.

83134,at-spi,atkbridge,not accessible widget,"Overview:   No event from gnome-cd/cddb track editor.Steps to reproduce:   Start gnome-cd application. Push Track editor push button.Actual result:   No event from at-spi.Expected results:   Events according with user actions.++This button is just made the same way as all the others, so can yougive me a way to test this?++Not the button itself has problems, the new opened window. This windowis not accessible.++That window is a seperate program called cddb-track-editor, so thatmight be the problem. It should be accessible, as most of it's widgetsare the standard ones.++Did you load gail-gnome ?i.e set GTK_MODULES=gail:atk-bridge:gail-gnomecddb-track-editor being a bonobo component will require gail-gnome to be loaded. Bill ?++right, you need gail-gnome in addition to gail.setting the GNOME_ACCESSIBILITY environment variable to 1 (or true, oranything non-null) should load libgail-gnome automatically.  Howeverif you are relying on the GTK_MODULES environment variable instead,then deepa is quite right, you would need to specify gail-gnome in theGTK_MODULES string as well, i.e.setenv GTK_MODULES gail:gail-gnome:atk-bridge(assuming c shell).or justsetenv GNOME_ACCESSIBILITY 1++o.k. I tried using at-poke. I was not able to see any events for applets and cddb-track-editor. My GTK_MODULES=gail:atk-bridge:gail-gnome.When i say ""Poke"" on gnome-panel, the tree view does not show any entries for the applets present in the panel. I had mini-commander, volume control & clock applet on my panel.Am i missing some setting or is there a problem with events from bonobo-components, Bill ?++I don't know, the libgail-gnome bonobo support has been shown to workin the past but there may be either regressions inlibbonobo/libbonoboui, or something could be abnormal about the panel.One distinct possibility is that the panel applets may not beinheriting the accessibility settings.  I would recommend using thegconf key for accessibility instead of the environment variable, asenv variables may not be getting inherited by bonobo out-of-processcomponents. The gconf key is in the /desktop/gnome/interface gconf 'directory'(not a real directory, but something used internally to gconf), youneed to set ""accessibility = true"".  You can do this with gconftool-2:gconftool-2 -R /   /desktop/gnome/interface:    ...    accessibility = falsethat reports all gconf settings.gconftool-2 --help should give some info on using gconftool-2, oremail darren.kenny@sun.com .  Under some circumstances you may not havea /desktop gconf directory, I am not sure what causes this, but insuch cases you must solve that problem first, then set the gconfaccessibility key to ""true"".++Thanks Bill, at-poke was able to detect applets. But the problem with detecting cdd-track-editor still seems to exists.++Ok - it's true that a11y is not enabled.This seems to be because the application is activated bybonobo-activation, and thus accessibility wise we assume it will be acontrol - and thus don't register a toplevel for it, reasoning that itwill be embedded in another window.In this case it's not true - and it's really unclear what to do aboutit . Really an at-spi bug I think.++Ok; so instead of using solely the bonobo_activation_iid_get check inat-spi/atk-bridge/bridge.c to see if we are a Control - we probablyalso need to add a GtkWindow hook in here like the one in gail:  gtk_type_class (GTK_TYPE_WINDOW);  signal_id  = g_signal_lookup (""show"", GTK_TYPE_WINDOW);  g_signal_add_emission_hook (signal_id, 0,    gail_toplevel_show_event_watcher, toplevel, (GDestroyNotify) NULL);and we need to register ourselves with the registry if a toplevelwindow is created ie. if the window is not a GtkPlug.Whether we should always delay registration until we throw up a realwindow is a moot point - perhaps not.++well, we definitely don't want to delay registration until we throw upa real window, since ATK/AT-SPI are intended to be functional fornon-GUI applications as well as GUI apps.But I don't think this is really the right fix.I think this raises another nasty issue... if embedded objects everlaunch toplevels which ""look"" to the user like separate applications(for instance, launchers), then we *do* want to treat the new toplevellike a separate application.  On the other hand, in the case of thecddb track editor, is that a ""new app"" which needs to register withthe accessibility registry, or is it a dialog child of the object (cdplayer)?I think it should be the latter, but the proposed fix would make itlook like a separate application.++Created attachment 12313  [details]  [review] Proposed patch++Propsoed patch has been reviewed on gnome-accessibility-devel and hasbeen committed."
366155,GStreamer,gst-plugins-good,[matroskademux] Several problems in encoding handling code,"There are some problems with the recent patch that adds support for track encodingIn gst_matroska_decode_buffer it is assumed that encoding type is compression. And therefore possibly uninitialized value enc.comp_algo is used. Matroska demuxer therefore tries to unzip encrypted tracks.Not all possible values of comp_algo are checked (comp_algo == 3 is missing), therefore new_data may stay NULL and buffer referencing NULL data may be pushed to sink pad.There is a for-cycle over all encodings, but new_data is generated allways from the original buffer (and old new_data leaked).Data should be decoded according to encoding order (I have sorted encodings decreasingly in enc.order in my patch)I have also removed \n from GST_WARNINGS(patch follows)++Created attachment 75556  [details]  [review] Fix several decoding problemsIn this patch, I do not print any warning that data decryption is not supported. In fact, EncodingType == 1 does not imply that the data are encrypted and can not be played as such.Also, I do not like printing warning for every buffer. It would be probably nicer to write the decryption warning only once.

(#366155)I'm not entirely sure what to do about buffers we can't decode or decompress. I am not really sure whether it's a good idea to push them as they are (as opposed to just dropping them).We might also want some check in place to ensure that there is at least one track we can decode and throw an error if not.It seems that according to the spec EncodingType == 1 && ContentEncAlgo == 0 means that the buffers are signed rather than encrypted. Is this what you meant or are there more cases?Not printing the warning for every buffer would indeed be a good idea. Care to make a patch for that too? :)Btw, if you happen to have some (not so big) sample files that use track encodings/compressions/encryptions, I'd be quite interested to get my hands on them."

Actual results:You get an error dialogue about Invoking patch failed, Please use GNU patchExpected results:Does this happen every time?yes provided that the 2 files under subversion are created according to the rules I laid out aboveOther information:I created a quick work around for this problem by simply using the subversion stored version(under .svn/text-base/FILE.svn-base) rather than using patch to undo the changes in my tree.Given the class structure, I think the proper fix is to create another method for the vc class, which ""knows"" how to create a clean copy of the file for meld to work on.  This way the existing SW can be reused by cvs,bz...and subversion can have a derived class which uses the stored svn copy rather than using patch.++Agreed - the vc provider should give us the files to compare instead of us trying to recreate them.++Simple test case from bug 661561 .1) add and commit a file to SVN containing a line like this:# $Id: file.txt 8936 2010-09-20 12:24:51Z piper $2) set the svn:keywords property on the file to ""Id"". Do NOT commit this changeto SVN!3) Try to view the file in meld.Might try to attach a SVN <1.6 patch here soon, if I can convince myself that it's not a terrible hack.++Created attachment 203296  [details]  [review] PatchThis patch adds a new file-getter API to our VC backend, and implements it for SVN. In my very limited testing, this fixes the bug. I'd appreciate some further feedback and testing from people who actually use subversion on a regular basis, since this is a big change to a central part of the SVN-handling code.Note that this *will not work* for SVN 1.7. For that version, using the new 'svn patch' command to obtain the original file may be a possibility.++Hi,It's five years since this was reported and it's still causing me trouble :-)For the record, I'm using meld 1.6.1, GNU patch 2.7 and SVN 1.7.6 (r1370777).I haven't study the sources of meld deeply, but I believe that the correct solution to make this work should be something like:1) Check svn:eol-style property when copying the compared file to temporary directory.2) Convert the file to line endings specified in eol-style.3) Apply the patch as usually, it should work now.I did few test in bash that should mimic the behavior of meld. Feel free to call me ignorant if I got it wrong :-) :# this is what currently happens when meld is comparing svn file:$ mkdir /tmp/meld$ cp Diag.h /tmp/meld$ svn diff Diag.h | patch -p0 -R -d /tmp/meld/ --dry-run patching file Diag.hHunk #1 FAILED at 19.1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file Diag.h.rej# this is what works correctly for me:$ mkdir /tmp/meld$ cp Diag.h /tmp/meld$ svn propget svn:eol-style Diag.h native$ sed -i 's/\r//g' /tmp/meld/Diag.h $ svn diff Diag.h | patch -p0 -R -d /tmp/meld/ --dry-run patching file Diag.hCould you implement a fix similar to this please? It is very annoying that half of my files can't be compared in meld, which is otherwise the best merge tool I ever worked with ;-)++Did you mean to add this comment to bug 613685 instead? Assuming so, we should continue discussion on that bug.The reason these bugs are still around is that I don't personally use Subversion, and developing against its quirks is... not fun. What would really help in developing a fix is an example repository that demonstrates the problem. If you could post a repro to create a broken repository that I can test against, I'll see whether I can make something work.As for your sample solution, surely we should convert the EOLs in the patch, not in the file itself? Otherwise we'll have the checkout file containing \r\n and the patched file with \n. While this *will* work in Meld currently because we ignore line endings in file comparisons, that's considered to be a bug, and we should at least notify of the difference.Converting EOLs in the patch may be a problem because our code supports multiple-file patches, and it's entirely possible that two files in a patch have different svn:eol-style properties. IIRC, I believe we never actually *use* multiple-file patches though, so maybe we could rip out support for that and proceed as above.++Of course, what I'd *really* like (almost as much as an example repo) is some testing or feedback on the patch I provided that should fix this issue in a much cleaner way. For anyone who was held back by lack of SVN 1.7 support, I've fixed that and have pushed a branch to: https://github.com/kaiw/meld/tree/DirectFileVC Please. Clone it, test it and let me know whether there are any issues. This is a major change to the infrastructure and I'm *not going to push it* without at least a few people confirming that it doesn't break in real use.++Hi Kai,Here are step by step instruction how to create the repo and demonstrate the problem:# create directory for repositorymkdir /tmp/repo# create local repositorysvnadmin create /tmp/repo# check out working copysvn co file:///tmp/repo /tmp/wc# create a fileecho -e ""some\ntext"" > /tmp/wc/file.txtfile /tmp/wc/file.txt# add file to svnsvn add /tmp/wc/file.txt# set eol-style to LFsvn propset svn:eol-style LF /tmp/wc/file.txt# commitsvn ci -m""first"" /tmp/wcfile /tmp/wc/file.txt# updatesvn up /tmp/wcfile /tmp/wc/file.txt# modify file & mess up its line-endingsecho -en ""some\r\nmore\r\ntext\r\n"" > /tmp/wc/file.txtfile /tmp/wc/file.txt# try running meldmeld /tmp/wc/file.txtI will also try to check the git branch today and let you know how it works.++Excellent! Thanks, that's really helpful. The patch appears to work for me for Subversion 1.7......except for a bug I recently introduced that appears to break directly invoking a version comparison on a single file. That has nothing to do with this however. Change the final line to run on the directory instead of the file itself and it should work fine.Either way, some further testing, especially in real world use, is needed.++(In reply to comment #6 ) > Of course, what I'd *really* like (almost as much as an example repo) is some> testing or feedback on the patch I provided that should fix this issue in a> much cleaner way.

It exhibits the same problem with the line endings. Also freezed at one point when comparing because of an IndexError:Traceback (most recent call last):++Let me know if I can help you more in any way with the eol-style issue.++So running that exact script you gave above fails on my system with Meld 1.6.1, and passes with that branch, after changing the last line to actually run the git copy of Meld rather than the system copy. Was that the test you were using, or something more complicated?Also, I've pushed a fix to the same branch for the bug I mentioned earlier with comparing single VC files.As for the second problem, any chance you could file a new bug with the files that caused that traceback?++I tested with my full repo and that is where the IndexError happened, I'll try to reproduce it again and file a new bug as you suggest. I also tried the simple test I sent before and it fails as well (with the ""Invoking 'patch' failed."" message box). I just hope I'm not invoking it wrong - I downloaded the whole branch from github as tar.gz, unpacked, and run ""make PYTHON=python2"" (I'm on ArchLinux where python 3 is default). Now I run the test with <path-to-the-extracted-archive>/bin/meld instead of just meld, that should be correct, right?++Created attachment 227227  [details]  [review] Debug patchYou shouldn't even need to run make. ""python2 bin/meld <filename or folder>"" from the archive directory should work just fine.You said earlier that you were running 1.6.1 by default? (and SVN 1.7?) if so, then just check the version number in the About dialog. The current git version is still shown as 1.6.0.Could you please apply this patch to your downloaded version and let me know what you get out? I'm trying to figure out whether SVN is still not giving the original files back, or whether there's a different bug that I'm missing.(Just run this on the example repo you provided. No point in getting the full dump for anything else until that works.)++Hi Kai,I also ran into this issue, when using meld to diff certain files. It was such a corner case. I was fixing a C file where the revision keyword has been capitalized incorrectly (""$REV"" instead of the correct ""$Rev""). The capitalization was preventing revision keyword expansion from working, so I fixed the capitalization, but when I tried to use meld to diff the file I got the good old ""Invoking 'patch' failed. Maybe you don't have 'GNU patch' installed..."" error.I cloned your DirectFileVC branch on your git repo, then applied your Debug patch and can confirm that your fix works.That said, would it be possible to post a diff which can be applied to the standard meld code (ideally the meld-1.6 branch)? I'd prefer to not have to use the DirectFileVC custom branch unless I have too...Thanks for the fix!Mark++Created attachment 230495  [details]  [review] Backported patchI'm attaching a patch that applies against 1.6.1. This patch is barely tested, so YMMV. I can't in good conscience actually push this on the stable 1.6 branch, since it's a significant change in the way we get our files, so it will have to stay here as an unsupported patch.++After a couple of extra fixes, I've decided to just push the current version to git. As a result, this bug should be fixed in current HEAD. If it resurfaces, please file a new bug (or re-open this one) with as many details as possible."

136581,libwnck,general,Fix window minimization vs. activation for mouse focus,"In both sloppy and click-to-focus modes, when I click on the window in thetasklist corresponding to the most recently activated window, the window isminimized.  If I click on any other window, the window is raised.In mouse focus, even if the window I click on was the most recentlyactivated window it can be activated instead of minimized.  This seemscounter-intuitive to me.  The reason for this is that in mouse focus thewindow will be deactivated by leaving the window, and libwnck useswas-currently-active logic instead of was-most-recently-activated logic.[Two sidenotes: (1) was-currently-active is slightly different thanis-currently-active, since the panel becomes activated when clicking on it. (2) was-most-recently-activated is different than Metacity's ""MostRecently Used"" concept--as it should be--since the most recently activatedwindow may no longer exist]I will attach a patch that fixes this.  I've tested with click-to-focus,sloppy focus, and mouse focus.  For click-to-focus and sloppy focus,there's no change in behavior, even for the corner cases that occurred tome (think ""switching workspaces in order to make no window focused insloppy focus"").

Let's say you have a single window on yourdesktop and it happens to be focused.  Let's say you want to minimize it.With click or sloppy focus, you move the mouse to the tasklist, click on theicon for the window, and it minimizes.  (because that window was activeimmediately prior to clicking on the panel tasklist applet)With mouse focus, you move the mouse to the tasklist, click on the icon for thewindow, and it activates the window.  Annoying.  The problem?  The window wasdefocused/deactivated when you moved the mouse outside of it.  My solution? Keep track of the most-recently-activated window.++Er....  let me change that last sentence to ""Keep track of the informationnecessary to determine the most-recently-activated-window.""  In particular, Ikeep track of the previously_active_window in addition to the active_window. The idea isif (active_window != NULL)  most_recently_activated_window = active_window;else  most_recently_activated_window = previously_active_windowand then use most_recently_activated_window instead of active_window todetermine whether to minimize.

This would have a fairly large one time hit to library consumers.  On the other hand, the code would be less of a mess.2) Pretend Mutter is a separate library at the introspection level (doable, not pretty)3) Add an option --accept-unprefixed to g-ir-scanner to accept this.I am working on a patch for 3).

MetaActor is going to produce a lot of constructions like: MetaActor *meta_actor = META_ACTOR (actor);In the patch I'm going to attach I went with MetaWindowActor and left MutterWindowGroup as MetaWindowGroup - it's not a very important object, so I didn't think it mattered much if it was a bit confusing with MetaGroup (a group of windows, another not very important object)If I was going to rename it I'd probably rename it to MetaWindowStack or something that doens't have 'group' in the name.++Created attachment 172628  [details]  [review] Remove Mutter namespace prefixMove all objects and functions namespaced with Mutter into the Meta namespaceto get a single consistent namespace.

I saw somewhere that it's supposed to allow people to apply/attach a color profile to a document, so that that profile goes with the document if it, say, travels to another computer.  I'd love to know how to do that before sending my pictures off to an online print service -- but can't figure out how.  I'm not at all sure I'm doing things right to preview how images will print, either.  So all in all, it would be great to have some help on the use of these features!Other information:Thanks!++I have found trying to use gimp color management without documentation very frustrating.  I've managed to figure out quite a bit through trial and error, but there are still things I don't understand.

That really assumed  in the first place that all tests would be run serially, and we want  them to be run in parallel. So we'll let Automake take care of the  stderr and debug outputs and redirect them to a per-test log file.- We use the significant-to-Automake variable TESTS instead of  TEST_PROGS. TESTS contains whatever is in check_PROGRAMS plus whatever  else we put into it (our test script.)- TESTS_ENVIRONMENT is also significant to Automake, but should not be  set within Automake, instead the AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT variable should  be used so that the developer can override TESTS_ENVIRONMENT from the  command line. This variable consists of a sequence of commands and  needs to end with a semicolon. (So we can stuff XVFB_START in there  too.)- We need to put the test invocation in a separate script since gtester  doesn't pass the --tap option on to its test binary.++Created attachment 340878  [details]  [review] build: Convert testCommandLine.sh to output TAPIt's nice to be able to see in the test output what exactly is failing.++Created attachment 340879  [details]  [review] build: Remove privlibdir in favour of pkglibdirElsewhere in the makefiles this is referred to as pkglibdir, so it wouldhave been broken anyhow if they were not the same.++Created attachment 340880  [details]  [review] build: Reorganize testing makefilesThese were a bit hard to navigate before, it was difficult to determinewhere to look if you wanted to write a test for new functionality.

94484,metacity,general,run_command gconf keys not sufficiently flexible,"While it is nice to be able to use gconf-editor to maintain the keybindingpreferences for the external keybindings, having only 12 possibilities istoo limiting.  My keyboard, for example, has a row of 19 buttons (Microsoftnatural pro) along the top that I'd like to bind to commands, but only 12commands are available.  I'd also like to be able to bind additional keysto other programs, like <Ctrl><Alt>e to emacs for example.My suggestion is as follows:Store in a gconf key a delimited list of bindings, so that the number ofpossible keybindings isn't limited by a fixed number.Alternatively, and I'm note sure if this is possible, simply iteratethrough run_command_N on N until a keybinding is found to be empty, andthen stop.  This would allow an arbitrary number of keybindings, but hasthe weakness that if a binding were to be deleted all the bindings with ahigher number would also be lost until they are shifted down.  Thisapproach does have the advantage of backwards compatibility, however(complete backwards compatibility could be ensured by only stopping theiteration if N > 12).Either of these approaches, however, would work well if the keybindingswere administered by the hypothetical Configuration Program.Please comment on this bug however to indicate which approach you thinkwould be best, or if you think that 640K ought to be enough for everyoneand we should leave it alone.Whatever we decide, I am willing to implement the changes.++We could just go up to 20, perhaps. Or 32, or whatever. Unlike the640K situation, we are limited by human wetware here (I don't thinkpeople are going to be able to remember a ton of bindings), so moore'slaw should not screw us. ;-) In fact you are the first person to wantmore than the 12. Do you actually use more than 12 daily or are youjust talking hypothetically?++I certainly wouldn't use nearly that many if I didn't have all theseextra buttons that I'd like to work.  This is not an uncommonkeyboard, and there are probably other metacity (or potentialmetacity) users who'd like to do the same as I.Perhaps 32 is a good number?  20 would give me exactly the number ofbindings I would (want to) use, but I doubt that I'm the person in theworld who wants to use the highest number available. (In reality Ican't map all the keys I'd like to -- like stop, refresh, back,forward, since mozilla doesn't support such chicanery).But my programmer instincts tell me that when I'm hardcoding in asmany as 32 things, I should just make it unlimited and be perfectlygeneral...++I'd sort of like to be general too, but being general here wouldintroduce special cases in several other places (keybindings editor,gconf schemas, etc.) so I'm not sure whether it's good.

Furthermore, in discussing this with Ray Strode at GNOME Boston 2008, it was determined that the name ""abort"" is not a good method for the orca.py:abort method, since aborting should really result in a core dump.

398033,GStreamer,gst-plugins-base,[audioconvert] support more than 8 channels,"Please describe the problem:The audioconvert element only supports a maximum of 8 channels. This causes problems with my Delta 44 sound card (as well as many other similar cards), which needs to send a 12 channel stream through audioconvert before it can be deinterleaved with the deinterleave plugin.Steps to reproduce:Actual results:Expected results:Does this happen every time?Other information:++*** Bug 395597 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++Two post scriptums: such cards can hold up to 24 channels, AND I would like to add a remark that lot of gstreamer audio elements doesn't support more than eight channels. Question is - it is design issue to have more channels or it was left for future to improve.++Don't think it's a design issue. However, the thing is that caps for more than 2 channels currently need to have a channel layout attached to them; having to specify these for lots of channels makes caps negotiation much slower; maybe we need to support default layouts for > 8 channels (with NONE positions for all channels) so this isn't so much of an issue then.++Created attachment 80965  [details]  [review] tentative patch; adds conversion support for an unlimited number of unpositioned channels++Created attachment 80966  [details]  [review] add some unit tests for unpositioned channel conversionUnit test seems to pass, but haven't done a lot of testing of these patches with multichannel positioned audio yet. I'm fairly sure there are still some kinks that need to be ironed out (I've seen an assertion warning somewhere at least).++Created attachment 80968  [details]  [review] new patch++Comment on attachment 80968  [details]  [review] new patchThe warning that was triggered with the previous patch in the case of  positioned 8-channel audio was just a thinko and harmless - it came from a [8, 8] integer range. This patch fixes this and adds a testcase for this to the unit test as well.++Created attachment 81014  [details] Level 5 log from attempting to use 12 channels with the new patchI've tried getting audio from my Delta 44 (12 channels) with the new patch, but I get the following warning:** (testsplit.py:14003): WARNING **: Failed to retrieve channel layout from caps. This usually means there is a GStreamer element that does not implement multichannel audio correctly. Please file a bug.Followed by an internal data flow error.++Created attachment 81057  [details]  [review] third attemptThird try: the above problem was caused by two things: - audioconvert's fixate function did not copy the channel-positions   over where possible/appropriate (it doesn't even make an attempt   to fixate channel positions at all either, but that's a different   problem and not really relevant in practice, I think). - audioconvert's transform_caps function did not set the   channel-positions field on the structures of the returned caps   eitherAn additional/alternative hack/solution could be to make gst_audio_get_channel_positions() automatically return a set of NONE positions for caps with more than 8 channels and no channel-positions in the caps, but then that would just cover up problems with code that will fail if there are <= 8 channels with NONE positions.++Created attachment 81162  [details] Third attempt patch to audiotconvert and testsplit.py script logI applied patch to CVS version. In result, testscript.py gave me strange results:1) When I launched it first time, it created 12 oggs, and spawned lot of error messages something about channel. I didn't log results and didn't listened to oggs, because I tought I could reproduce it2) BUT in second launch it didn't reproduce it, but it went to create two splits from PCM instead, creating two oggs. Both of them contains constant click noise, nothing more;This log is from second launch.++I think that's more a problem with the test script than anything, I've edited the test script slighty and have it producing oggs without any errors (although the oggs are only a very short length I think this is due to the stream not being allowed to finish properly, just ctrl-c'd). I'll try and integrate deinterleave into Jokosher over the next few days so we can see how it works in a proper pipeline. But it looks to me as though the audioconvert problem is fixed now, thanks a lot :).++Created attachment 81273  [details]  [review] New patchPrevious patch still has a problem: I just ran into this assertion with the thehillshaveeyes trailer:** CRITICAL **: gst_audio_get_channel_positions: assertion `gst_value_array_get_size (pos_val_arr) == channels' failedcaps has 2 channels and a channel-position array with 8 channel positions. Looks like somewhere (in transform_caps?) we manage to produce caps with a [1; 8] channel range AND channel-positions and the fixate function later fixates the channel number on that later. The bug might have existed before but was conveniently covered up by the fact that the fixate function stripped channel positions in certain circumstances anyway, I think.The updated patch removes channel-positions fields from the new output structure in transform_caps() if setting a channel range on the copied structure. This fixes problems if the input structure had 8 channels input.Also added unit tests for this problem.++Created attachment 85035  [details]  [review] same patch, but against current cvs++Last patch (#13) + Gst CVS from 22nd of March + test script gave me this:** (test.py:9667): CRITICAL **: gst_audio_get_channel_positions: assertion `gst_value_array_get_size (pos_val_arr) == channels' failed/bin0/deinterleave0.src0 (gst.Pad)** (test.py:9667): CRITICAL **: gst_audio_get_channel_positions: assertion `gst_value_array_get_size (pos_val_arr) == channels' failed/bin0/deinterleave0.src1 (gst.Pad)** (test.py:9667): CRITICAL **: gst_audio_get_channel_positions: assertion `gst_value_array_get_size (pos_val_arr) == channels' failed/bin0/deinterleave0.src2 (gst.Pad)** (test.py:9667): CRITICAL **: gst_audio_get_channel_positions: assertion `gst_value_array_get_size (pos_val_arr) == channels' failed/bin0/deinterleave0.src3 (gst.Pad)** (test.py:9667): CRITICAL **: gst_audio_get_channel_positions: assertion `gst_value_array_get_size (pos_val_arr) == channels' failed/bin0/deinterleave0.src4 (gst.Pad)** (test.py:9667): CRITICAL **: gst_audio_get_channel_positions: assertion `gst_value_array_get_size (pos_val_arr) == channels' failed/bin0/deinterleave0.src5 (gst.Pad)** (test.py:9667): CRITICAL **: gst_audio_get_channel_positions: assertion `gst_value_array_get_size (pos_val_arr) == channels' failed/bin0/deinterleave0.src6 (gst.Pad)** (test.py:9667): CRITICAL **: gst_audio_get_channel_positions: assertion `gst_value_array_get_size (pos_val_arr) == channels' failed/bin0/deinterleave0.src7 (gst.Pad)** (test.py:9667): CRITICAL **: gst_audio_get_channel_positions: assertion `gst_value_array_get_size (pos_val_arr) == channels' failed/bin0/deinterleave0.src8 (gst.Pad)** (test.py:9667): CRITICAL **: gst_audio_get_channel_positions: assertion `gst_value_array_get_size (pos_val_arr) == channels' failed/bin0/deinterleave0.src9 (gst.Pad)** (test.py:9667): CRITICAL **: gst_audio_get_channel_positions: assertion `gst_value_array_get_size (pos_val_arr) == channels' failed/bin0/deinterleave0.src10 (gst.Pad)** (test.py:9667): CRITICAL **: gst_audio_get_channel_positions: assertion `gst_value_array_get_size (pos_val_arr) == channels' failedGST_DEBUG=*:5 is coming.++Created attachment 85127  [details] Gst debug log of level 5 using patch #13 + cvs gst + test script++Last patch #13 + Gst CVS from 25nd of March  + test script gave me no errors spawned as previously mentioned, and deinterleave gave all 12 channels, bet there was no output produced at all - just zero size 0.ogg, and no other ogg files for corresponding channels.See attachment for gst level 5 log.++Created attachment 85238  [details] Gst debug log of level 5 using patch #13 + cvs gst 25th March + test script++Any news on this?++> Any news on this?

Perhaps camel should justrun the expunge in another thread itself, since it can ref the foldersbefore it starts the expunge (perhaps an option to expunge?).I'm marking as 1.0.x: at worst the behaviour is annoying, and anythingto fix it is likely to be risky since it deals with exit behaviour.++*** bug 215119 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++notzed: have these patches been committed?I assume the bug is still not fixed++*** bug 217105 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++No not fixed.

Please reference bug #89221 for more comments.)Set decoration from TRUE to FALSE worked.  But set decoration from FALSE toTRUE failed: the window simply disappeared.  Try the following test:#include <gtk/gtk.h>static void destroy_callback(GtkObject *object, gpointer data){    gtk_main_quit();}static void clicked_callback(GtkWidget *widget,                             gpointer data){    static gboolean decoration = 1;    if (decoration) {        gtk_window_set_decorated(GTK_WINDOW(data), FALSE);    } else {        gtk_window_set_decorated(GTK_WINDOW(data), TRUE);    }    decoration = !decoration;}int main(int argc, char *argv[]){    GtkWidget *window;    GtkWidget *button;    gtk_init(&argc, &argv);    window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);    g_signal_connect(window, ""destroy"", G_CALLBACK(destroy_callback), NULL);    button = gtk_button_new_with_label(""Toggle Decoration"");    g_signal_connect(G_OBJECT(button), ""clicked"",                     G_CALLBACK(clicked_callback), window);    gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), button);    gtk_widget_show_all(window);    gtk_main();    return 0;}------- Additional Comments From Matthias Clasen 2002-07-28 15:40 -------After a little experimentation, only metacity seems to monitor the mwm hints on mapped toplevels, sawfish, fvwm and blackbox only read thehints whenthe window leaves the withdrawn state. And even metacity gets itwrong, as you discovered. I don't know of any spec for mwm hints, thusI can't say if wms are supposed to monitor the hints. Given thecurrent state of affairs, I think it would be good if the docs forgtk_window_set_decorated would recommend using this function only onhidden windows. In fact, inserting gtk_widget_hide () /gtk_widget_show () around the clicked_callback in your testcase makesit work with metacity, sawfish, fvwm and blackbox. (Unfortunately,with fvwm, I get Gdk-WARNING **: GdkWindow 0x1200003 unexpectedly destroyedafter a few iterations, but this is probably unrelated.)++Just checked with the latest metacity sources. Setting decoration fromFALSE to TRUE works. Guess, its fixed.++Yes I did fix this the other day."

89390,metacity,general,should not save session state for a Global style save,"Description of Problem:When I log out and have apps running that don'tsupport session management a warning dialog isdisplayed. However, this dialog is also displayedwhen I _don't_ have the 'save session' checkboxselected on the logout dialog. In that case it shouldn't be displayed because itdoesn't matter if the apps support 'save yourself'or not.Steps to reproduce the problem:1. Run an app that doesn't do session management2. Log out with 'save session' checkbox _not_ selectedHow often does this happen? all the timeAdditional Information:++The dialog is actually popped up by Metacity.I think the problem here is actually shared between the panel, session manager *and* metacity.At the moment when the panel requests a SaveYourself it request aglobal *and* local save. In reality, though, we only want apps to savetheir files etc., and if the user selects 'save current setup' onlythen do we want a local save as well ...So a proposed solution:1) Panel requests a global only save2) If the use selects 'save current setup' then we ammend the savetype to 'Both'3) Metacity only saves its state and pops up the lame client dialog if it is a local save ...Havoc: what do you think ?++I sorted all this out with Matthias a while back on xdg-list. There is some specific behavior we should follow. See xdg-listarchived thread titled ""session management subtlety"" or something likethat, some months ago for extensive discussion.++I think I've read that thread twice before .... not again ... :-)will do ...++https://listman.redhat.com/pipermail/xdg-list/2001-November/000192.html here's the link for reference++here's my mail on it to xdg-list https://listman.redhat.com/pipermail/xdg-list/2002-July/000615.html++So my summary from https://listman.redhat.com/pipermail/xdg-list/2001-December/000201.html was as follows:This means apps really need only three kinds of message: a) save current state, but don't ask about saving unsaved     documents, we aren't logging out. don't worry about     saving temporary document files; just handle it gracefully     if files change (e.g. open an empty window if a document     has disappeared when we restore) b) we're logging out, so ask about saving documents, but     don't save session state as user didn't want that c) we're logging out, so ask about saving documents, but do     save session state since user requested itSo the question is how do we encode those in the flags actually passedto SaveYourself. SaveYourself has fast = TRUE/FALSE, shutdown =TRUE/FALSE, and style = Local/Global/Both. That allows 12 different messages, right, and we only need 3. ;-)I think your suggestion is: Local = a) Global = b) Both = c)And shutdown/fast are just hints that are mostly ignored, I guess.Then we also have to specify that if the style includes Global,interaction must be allowed; Global save with interact = None would benonsense.++XSMP really sucks doesn't it ;-)++Sorry - I missed all that ...Shutdown is only useful to session manager as a way for an app torequest a out. I don't see how its useful to the since we have a Diemessage.Fast isn't particularily useful either I don't think. Maybe fast couldbe a used as a hint not to bother users with a 'lame clients' dialog :-)Anyway, the summary that you posted is more or less the understandingI got from reading the spec over and over ...I don't think the protocol itself sucks too much. But the specscertainly do - nowhere near enough clarification. I think the xdgcould certainly fill the gap there ...So, anyway - as regards this plan. Does it sound reasonable ? Wouldyou accept a patch for metacity to only save window states if style !=Global ?++Yes, should be a simple patch, and sounds right.++Okay, I've committed the gnome-panel and gnome-session parts. I'llappend the metacity part.++Created attachment 10162  [details]  [review] Patch for this bug and an update of the window type list in theme-format.txt that must have been lying there for a while++Alright to commit ?++Patch looks fine, I would add a comment pointing to the xdg-listarchives or otherwise explaining what's going on.

This differs from toggling contracted braille with either pattern.  Committed to master.++Closing as fixed.  Seems to work nicely."

201093,evolution,Mailer,Various gettext-related problems,"The message list Date code does not convert from the locale charset to UTF8++OK, we need a function that converts from ""the charset that gettext returns""to UTF8. How do we know what charset gettext uses? Lauris?++This affects the ""To:"", ""From:"", etc in the headers of the maildisplay too...++Unless somebody has better idea, we can use e_utf8_from_gtk_string, givensome well-known widget as argument. It has additional benefit, that native<-> utf8 conversion happens in single place throghout app, so we do not haveto maintain separate iconv hashes.++For such tasks I suggest different function -- not to get from gtk, but extractfrom po file. It is very simple: _("""") returns the header of po file, whichcontains ""Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-13\n"" i.e it is a couple ofstring manipulation functions to get the real charset messages are in. Thenconvert to utf8.But... it is possible that gettext converts from catalog (*.mo) charset tolocale charset automatically. Then this approach won't fit. But in most caseslocale and gettext files are in the same charset.++Im pretty sure this is no longer an issue now that date stuff is donein ETable. However, if it is - just reopen it."
611196,gnome-control-center,Online Accounts,Integrate web services into about me,"Most of the information in the about-me capplet can be gotten from the user's various social network services, there should be a way to automatically retrieve this data from facebook, twitter, etc.The ubuntu 10.04 FUSA applet has a ""broadcast accounts"" menu option which enables gwibber configuration, perhaps this can be expanded to more tightly integrate these services into GNOME.I think we should define a spec (maybe this should be at fdo?) of a place to store social network information so that any application that would like to connect does not need to separately collect account info, then in about-me we could look to see what accounts have been configured (and also allow connecting to new accounts?) and allow the user to use their info from the social network of their choice, and also just allow manual entering/editing of information.++I think this suggestion very important to enrich the user experience for desktop environment. I suggested at the Ubuntu Brainstorm site with similar functionality. http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/26056/++Gnome 3.0 doesn't have an About Me applet, so this should be set to OBSOLETE, I think.++We have gnome-online-accounts integrated in GNOME 3.2, though it currently lacks a number of services.

It's not ""every message with an attatchment"". Ican't make out the pattern. Mail yourself the message I attatched as acase of the thing.++you didn't attach any message...++The ""attatchment"" is inline with the bugreport, between the ""CUT HERE""lines. Sorry for that, I wasn't very carefull with this bugreport'swriting.++well, that's not a message.++No, but sending that text in a message to yourself will trigger theoffline mode bug.++I've just checked that this bug is present in evolution 1.4.0 and I'veseen an interesting patern.The messages where this happens are the messages that have inside~/evolution/mail/... a file named $messagenumber.HEADER. I'm guessingthat evo is failing to use these kinds of messages as cache for somereason. Is this very hard to fix? It's annoying to not be able to seea message offline that is available in evo's cache.++The bug is present in evo 1.4.3 and I think I found the offending code.In evolution/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c inimap_get_message(...):/* If the server doesn't support IMAP4rev1, or we already have	 * the whole thing cached, fetch it in one piece.	 */	if (store->server_level < IMAP_LEVEL_IMAP4REV1 ||	    (stream = camel_imap_folder_fetch_data (imap_folder, uid, """",TRUE, NULL)))		return get_message_simple (imap_folder, uid, stream, ex);	/* If we're not actually connected and it's not in the cache,	 * that's as far as we can go.	 */	if (camel_disco_store_check_online (CAMEL_DISCO_STORE (store), ex) ==FALSE)		return NULL;Basically the first ""if"" checks to see if a ""$(messagenumber)."" cacheentry exists and fetches it from cache if it does. The second ""if""checks if we're online and fails if not. The cache is never checkedfor messages with "".HEADER"" or "".somenumber"" files. I guess this meansthat evo doesn't use it's cache at all for large messages.The analysis could be wrong since this is the first time I've lookedat evo's code.++I'm guessing this would go either within the ""IMAP rewrite"" bug ormaybe  mail hackers can fix it before. Giving this up to fejjie and Notzed.++I'm seeing the same thing, for what it's worth. Pedro, did you evertry to patch this yourself?++I looked at it for a while and talked to fejj about it. If I remembercorrectly the problem was that evo didn't save a body structure forthe message. You'd need to change the imap code to have that saved tobe able to reconstruct the message. Since the imap code was labeled asspaghetti code and since I wasn't that annoyed by the bug I didn't tryto patch it.++*** bug 249829 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++fixed in a patch a while back... can't remember if it made it into 1.4branch or not tho. definetely in 1.5 tho, so closing.++Debians evo 1.4.5-3 from sid still has the problem. Glad to know 1.5has it fixed, the release looks like it will rock, thanks for all thehard work."
239335,evolution,Mailer,Offline mode only caches unread messages,Description of Problem:If you have IMAP folders with read and unreadmessages and want to go offline and read themwithout net access you have to have used Evolutionto read every one of the already read messagesbecause the offline mode only caches the unread ones.Steps to reproduce the problem:1. Get an IMAP account with read and unread messages2. Go offline3. Try to read already read messagesIf this worked properly one could use IMAP withit's consistent-mail-archive-everywhere featureand without the drawback of having to be alwaysconnected to the net.++this was fixed a year ago or so
91882,metacity,general,Request a method of raising / lowering windows,"I think there should be a way to tell a window to ""lower"" itself.For example, in Sawfish, right clicking on the title bar of the windowwould lower it such that any windows behind it would be put in theforeground.  This is especially useful when there is a large windowcompletely hiding the window you want to get to; currently, the only way toget to a totally obstructed window is to either Alt-Tab or use the taskswitcher.++This is also my main complaint about metacity. It is of coursepossible to bind lower of raise_or_lower but I lack the abilityto lower a window using the mouse. Lower could be mapped to the middle mouse button which doesnot seem to be used. Another way could be to add an entry 'Lower' to the menu.++Created attachment 11690  [details]  [review] map raise_or_lower to button 2++The patch above maps raise_or_lower to the button 2for 'sloppy' or 'follow mouse' modes. It is disabled for 'click to focus' mode to prevent  obscured focussed windows.++This is already done in CVS, I think.++Houps! sorry. I see in CVS that button 2 is mapped to lower.Wouldn't it be better to map it to raise_or_lower?raise_or_lower may seem complex but it has a veryintuitive behavior. With it you can navigate efficiently over all opened windows using a single button. If you are not conviced then give it a try.btw if you do that, you will probably notice that raise_or_lower is broken at least in the last release. For example, consider 3 windows and minimize the one on top. Then apply raise_or_lower to the one now on top. It does not lower as expected. A second raise_or_lower is required.++If seems that raise_or_lower considers all above windowsuncluding unmapped windows. Testing 'above->mapped' in theloop seems to solve the problem at least for iconified windows.++2002-10-20  Havoc Pennington  < hp@pobox.com >	* src/keybindings.c (handle_raise_or_lower): check          above->mapped 	before deciding if it overlaps the window being raiselowered, 	fix from Stephane Chauveau I think raise_or_lower is a bit too hard to explain for the button behavior (and after all you can always just click left mouse).raise_or_lower really only exists because dtwm had it and Sun wanted to match that feature, I think it's bound to some key on the Sun keyboard."

Since it's possible to move the panel applet with a right-click, select Move, I'm inclined to mark this WONTFIX.++*** Bug 411906 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++From bug 411906 :The Tomboy applet cannot be moved on the panel by dragging it with the middlemouse button. Instead the date is inserted into the Start Here note. Evenworse, this functionality is not obvious and is not present in the menu either!Tomboy should adhere to Gnome customs and allow applet movement with the middlemouse button.++You see. It really confuses people as long as it doesn't behave the same way the other applets behave. And as #359168 is almost solved, the old functionality won't be lost but is available more transparently through the regular tomboy user interface.++As there is/was a bug about adding add-date as a plugin - which would be more obvious for users - I think we should really move on with dropping this inconsistency for GNOME 2.22.So, please add the tool from bug 359168 and then fix this bug.++I agree with Sven, but maybe that's because I've never used this feature?  Confirming and setting target to to 0.9.x.Now would be a good time for any big supporters of the middle-click-inserts-date-into-start-note feature to speak up.  ;-)++So, insert-date got added to the tools now, will this bug be next? (This is a real inconsistency with the rest of GNOME)++I sent another email to the list to see if anybody defends the current behavior.

Middle-Click on the applet still inserts the current date and primary buffer.++It only works if you have a Start Note.++This is probably one of the most annoying misfeatures in all of Gnome at the moment. I'd like to see it go away, please. And thanks, Sandy, for the workaround :-)++Committed in r1770 (small change to patch: schema defaults pref to 'false' instead of 'true').I don't see any reason to expose this in the Preferences dialog.++Isn't this hidden preference much in the spirit of a --do-not-be-broken command line option?++(In reply to comment #16 ) > Isn't this hidden preference much in the spirit of a --do-not-be-broken command> line option?> Technically, wouldn't it be more like a --be-broken command line option, since we default to the standard applet behavior now?  ;-)The hidden preference allows the user to override default applet behavior with a special behavior that they find more useful.  I doubt they would consider it broken when they explicitly enable it.  Plus, you can always move the applet by right-clicking and selecting move.And, of course, some people run Tomboy in the notification area and not in the panel.  But I don't see any reason to restrict this feature to that."

Cursor theming is what bug #69436 istalking about, and it hasn't been implemented yet.  My patch is just ahack that works right now.++It would be nice to get this into Gdk (minus the g_print). It seems pretty natural to map these directly back onto the Win32 builtin cursors when available. The theme engine shouldn't have to worry about remapping cursors.++Makes sense to me. Tor, what do you think ?++Will an application look odd if some cursors are the builtin ones and others are the X11 ones? Maybe not a big deal. I'll check what it looks like and apply the patch unless it looks really horrible... Or maybe it should be user-overridable through .gtkrc?++Committed to trunk and gtk-2-10.I did change two of the arrows, though.  I set ""sb_h_double_arrow"" to IDC_SIZEWE and ""sb_v_double_arrow"" to IDC_SIZENS (they were set to NULL in Tim's patch).  I did this because paned widgets use these Gdk cursors and these two look much better than what was being used by default."

This isn't merely an 'enhancement', it's necessary! Why hasn't thisbeen fixed yet?Sorry for being rude.++As I stated the last time:International date/time standards are there for a reason. A Calendar is expectedto follow them. This bug has been around for more than 4 years now. http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/popstds/datesandtime.html  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html Suitable Severitylevel: ""Major  	Major loss of functionality- menu item broken,data output extremely incorrect, or otherwise difficult/useless to use.""++Are there any Europeans involved with Evolution developement? It's shame thatthis kind of basic things are still broken in core GNOME application. I agreethat severity should be major.++Forget Europeans.  Try are there any non-American (and more spefically non-NorthAmerican) Evolution developers.I'm astounded that Evolution could have been through two major number releasesand a handful of minor number releases and still not handing non-US date formats.  Surely GTK+ has a widget for handling such things, and if not, then why not.This is quite embarrassing for an application that handles calendars and taskmanagement can't do dates properly.++That kind of attitude (of the Evolution developers) doesn't help GNOME to spreadin other parts of the world. KDE has had excellent i18n for years and maybe thatis one of the many reasons why it's so popular in Europe. Of course, I know that there are almost one thousand Evolution bugs to fix inBugzilla and the developers have been very busy and hard-working with them.Thanks for them for that! However, I wish they wouldn't ignore the basic things.++I can't find any other explanation for this bug being still open than that the Evolution developers don't understand what it is about. The bug title as well as the initial descriptions don't match very well with the latter comments and the duplicate bugs. I propose that title should be changed to something like: ""Components don't follow the system date settings"". Also, this should be *bug*, not a feature postponed to distant future.++As there is no way of telling from say ""06/08/2006"" if this means August 6th or June 8th, I have to remind myself every time I look at a Task that my project start date is in the, to us foreigners, counter-intuitive US mm/dd/ccyy format. If Evolution can internationalise language and time, surely it can manage this rather obvious tweak. Sorting tasks in order of selected field would be nice too, but lets get the basics right first.++I think there should be an option to set the date format for other than the Locale.  This can be important when there is a conversion or difference between the Locale settings and the prefered format.I have yet to find a simple way to convert my Linux box to a custom setting for date/time etc.  The locale of choice doesn't have the date format that our organization uses by default.  Of course there are times that we have users that want to use their prefered date format.I want to be able to choose ISO date format even though my Locale is set for Canada.I also don't like the idea that Evolution decides that I want just the time displayed or Yesterday or Today.  I want YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM for everything.  I find this very distracting and annoying to the point of just closing Evolution when I am not reading.++This bug is only six years old now. :)++I am astonished to find that this bug, and it is a B*U*G not an enhancement, is still unaddressed. Perhaps there should be a new severity category called Embarrassment for highly visible problems that are not actually broken or malfunctioning, just ... well ... embarrassing.As I am now using KDE and Kontact/Kmail this bug is no longer bugging me, so I bid  it farewell.++I have given up on Evolution after 10 months of headaches.This date issue is just one of them, the most minor one.++Note that there are two separate issues here:1) Some (many) people would like a way to specify date formats in Evolution.2) Local settings are not respected.The first is a popular enhancement request.  The second is a bug (see bug 256905 , bug 344516 , and bug 348929 ).  The end result for the user is of course the same whatever the cause, a calendar that can not display dates correctly.++Actually, I'd add third issue. My biggest complaint is that date formats are inconsistent, making it a pain to figure out when mail was sent or received. When I look at my inbox, I see dates like this: Mon 05:30 PM May 18 2006 Yesterday 07:02 AM Jan 10 11:14 PM 04:19 PMWhile having a way to specify my preferred date format would be great, I'd settle for simple having a consistent presentation of the date. Sometimes it tells what the month is, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes we get the year or day of the week, sometimes we don't. Aside from the sheer inconvenience and weirdness of doing it this way, I would think it makes the code unnecessarily complex to have it use random date formats instead of a single consistent one...++Am I the only person with a problem inputting 4-digit years?  Like a contacts birthday in 1950, gets treated by calendar as though it were 2050.  If the iso debate means we get YYYY-MM-DD, that might fix things..  (though being from the UK I prefer DD-MM-YYYY).Still, I can't see the point of having a birthday slot that can't be used for anyone over 30yrs old.  I ask myself, why would the developers provide a birthday slot if you can't use it?  Very odd..++Any progress?  After seven years, this bug still fails to be addressed, and it IS a serious functionality flaw for anybody who is not accustomed the North American M/D/YY date format.I've stuck with Evolution as a mail client because of its other features, but if I wasn't attached to those, I would have given up on it long ago because of this single bug.  I cannot even imagine trying to use the calendar component, if evolution will not allow me to choose how my dates and times are displayed.Ideally, Evolution should respect the date format of my locale, but if that, for whatever reason, cannot be implemented, I need to at least be able to configure it within Evolution.  The relative dates in the message listing also need to be an optional feature.Can anybody even attempt a patch?  I would if I could, but I'm no developer.++Hello... does anybody care?  These are the sort of bugs that keep gnome from becoming scalable.  Also, I'm tired of scanning my indox and having to mentally translate every date to something meaningful—the most recent ones are displayed only in terms of weekday, and before that, they are displayed only in terms of date, so I can't relate them in my head.  I don't want to come off as non-developer who can only nag, but I don't know how else to fix this.If dates worked in a predictable fashion, then I could understand this bug being filed as an enhancement, but as it stands, I'm sure I'm not the only one who finds this highly annoying, so it really seems to deserve a higher priority, considering the few lines it would take to fix it.++*** Bug 303420 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 443824 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 506988 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 519527 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 573877 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 336253 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 348929 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 323289 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 332792 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 350825 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 256905 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++For me the current biggest anoyance (with 2.26) is the 12 hour clock display in the mail folder display.

I attach a patch that implements this change.I can only guess someone chose to use the '%l:%M %p' pattern because he wanted to avoid displaying the seconds.Looking at the source code for 2.26 there are 1506 instances of the date pattern '%l:%M %p'.

I thought to change all localizeable date/time formats in evolution, those for entering too, but after looking around it's quite impossible, not only because of the parsing part is in eds, but also because some parts strictly require some short or long format, where I do not trust users to enter such there. It should be quite easy to extend this for more parts/entering fields, but the only issue I faced is how to configure it in some not-to-get-user-crazy-of-that way.I put there few predefined formats, but users can write there anything acceptable in strftime, with new tag %ad for an abbreviated date (it's the one used in a mailer's table). I thought of writing some sort of help section for it, but I do not have proper tools handy to do that, and killing an xml file is not the best thing, I believe. Thus see 'man strftime' for more information what one can write there.++Created attachment 138063  [details] e-util/e-datetime-format.h++Created attachment 138064  [details] e-util/e-datetime-format.c++Thinking of all the duplicates I marked here recently, it's possible I was wrong with some of them. I'm not sure now.++If it helps, there are at least two distinct bugs here. One is that the date format is not configurable and the other is that date format, configurable or not, is not used consistently. Apparently the date format actually used depends on the relative age of the date and not the users chosen format. So to fix the first bug, there needs to be way for the user to configure the date format.To fix the second bug, there needs to be way for the user to force evolution to actually use the configured date format consistently rather than only after some arbitrary amount of time has passed. In other words if want my dates formatted as YYYY MM DD, HH:MM:SS, I want *ALL* my dates formatted that way, not just dates that are two weeks old or whatever. I don't want it drop the Year if it's one week old or display ""Yesterday"" instead of my selected format if it's 24 hours old.++(In reply to comment #67 ) > ... Yes, that does the patch and attached new files above. I'm still talking about showing date and time, not entering it. You can configure this differently for calendar and mail components. There is a configuration for an addressbook too, though it seems it's not used at the moment.++In response to comment 67 , yes from the perspective of someone using evolution these are two separate issues.  I would class the date format used being neither configurable nor taken from the user's locale as a bug whereas the date format varying depending on the age of the message is a mis-feature, i.e. someone has gone to some trouble to make it work that way but the result is not to everyone's taste.From a technical point of view the two are intimately related.  In order to implement the fancy ""date format changes with age of message"" feature the developer has embedded 6 different date formats into the code none of which respects the user's locale.  Having six date formats to configure in a preferences dialogue is probably too many.I'll now try Milan's patch and see how I get on.++The patch seems to work fine for the Etables across components. e-datetime-format.c is not thread-safe. would that be a problem ? I guess since it can be only changed from preferences, it think it should be safe.The mailer and address-book options are provided in wrong tabs. Maybe for mailer the label tab can be named in a generic way for the users to be able to find it faster. But for address-book i don see a place, maybe a new tab ? (not sure).And can we have the default values as abbreviated form (as they are currently) so that it does not surprise users who are used to the abbreviated form. And people who want to use the default locale format can choose from preferences ?This needs to be committed within this week as we have a UI freeze coming up next week.++(In reply to comment #70 ) > The patch seems to work fine for the Etables across components.> e-datetime-format.c is not thread-safe. would that be a problem ?

This is hard, I've not much idea here. What about putting date/time format options into Headers tab for mailers. It has a bit sense to have it there.The totally different option can be to use a special Component for it, like we have for network preferences, and have all the formats on one place, for different views.

If we do creations by,basically, pasting a copy of a hidden default object, we'd loose thatfunctionality.For this reason, I propose a new function to ObjectTypeOps:   Object * (*CreateFromDefaultFunc) (Object *obj)if it's NULL, the core uses type->ops->object_copy() instead, if it isn't,it gives objects a chance to do their own stuff (perhaps tweaking the newobject after calling object_copy_using_properties() )James, what do you think of this ?++Mass reassign of bugs to dia-maint@bugzilla.gnome.org .++The first implementation just landed in cvs:2002-06-15  Hans Breuer  < hans@breuer.org >	* lib/object_defaults.c : (new file) manage default properties 	of dia objects. The serialization is done with standard	object methods in a diagram compatible format.	* lib/object.c : add object_registry_foreach() which allows	to iterate over all registered object types	* lib/object.h : added prototypes object_default*() and	object_registry_foreach()	* lib/makefile.am lib/makefile.msc : add new file to build	* lib/libdia.def : export new functions	* app/defaults.c : provide StdProp based defaults if the	ObjectType doesn't implement it's own default functions	* app/create_object.c : through dia_object_default_create()	* app/disp_callbacks.c : same hereHaving it some new quetions arise though:- At first view the new StdProp based defaults handling appears  to supersede the old object specific default handling (which   would allow to remove most of the latter).   Looking at standard::box as an example the old code only offers   to change the default for 'draw background' and 'corner radius',  while the new code offers to set defaults for 'line <style|color|width>'  etc..   _But_ storing these defaults on a per object base does at the moment  take away the ability to use the current toolbox settings (as is done   with the old code). I have no strong preference for either of these options -  they are both handy from time to time.  It seems to suggest to let the user choose. This again can be done either  on a per object base: checkbox per property like 'prefer global default'  (probably easy done by adding another PROP_FLAG_) or globally with a  PROP_FLAG_DONT_DEFAULT, which would hide the respective property from  the defaults dialog.   Another possibility would be a real global option to _always_ replace  StdProps which have a toolbox equivalent, i.e. PROP_STD_LINE_COLOUR,  PROP_STD_FILL_COLOUR, PROP_STD_LINE_WIDTH, PROP_STD_LINE_STYLE, ...  at interactive object creation time. This would allow some more consistent  behaviour for all the objects. Ever wondered why some objects are colored   with the toolbox settings and some don't (e.g. UML::Class) ?- Somewhat related: The default-by-StdProp code imposes some never  seen stress to the StdProp implementation, especially if it gets  called with dia_object_defaults_load(NULL, FALSE /*==!create_lazy*/).  This does create _every_ known object at startup time and saves all  of them with dia_object_defaults_save()  E.g. there is some Dia internal confusion about the  differences between a string being NULL or """". AFAICS there is no  pratical difference but some UML objects for example do treat it  different. The 'stereotype' does not get rendered if it is NULL  but it does when it is the empty string.  The StdProp code isn't capable to handle NULL strings and it probably  should not learn. To me it appears to be the cleanest way to make  the UML code (and any other occurences) handle NULL and """" the same  and prefer the """" representation, which would allow to strlen() on  any platform while strlen(NULL) seems to be allowed with GCC only (?).++We should think carefully about how to handle the object defaults that appear in the toolbox.  Our first concern should be to avoid surprises.  The usage should be consistent across all objects, and it should be obvious what is in effect when.  After that, we can consider power uses.The simplest solution would be to never have the toolbox equivalent in the object default dialogs.  No surprises, but limited power.  I think this is what we should go with at first.If we have per-object defaults for the toolbox options, I cannot think of a behaviour that wouldn't give surprises.  Having a checkbox for each property for each object would be cumbersome and confusing.Let's just for now allow only the toolbox widgets for those objects and concentrate on other stuff.

Do you suggest to disable the new defaultproperties code in cvs without giving anyone else the possibilty just look at it or get used to it?++No, I'm saying that any defaults that would be taken from the toolbox widgets should not show up in the default properties dialogs.  That is the simplest possible solution:  Never can the same default property be set in two different places.Now for things like line widths -- I guess for objects that don't want to use the 'standard' line width, they should call it something else:  Border width, for instance.  Of course there will be disagreements as to which objects should use the 'global' defaults and which not.++The toolboxable defaults now don't show up in defaults dialogs, and objects take the defaults from the toolbox.

Thanks)------- Bug moved to this database by unknown@bugzilla.gnome.org 2003-01-12 22:48 -------Reassigning to the default owner of the component, hp@redhat.com .++I just want to point out that this is actually a regression.  Focusused to follow the mouse pointer in Red Hat Linux 8.0, even after aworkspace switch.++Why does this bug exist at all?  You should get an EnterNotify onwhichever window the mouse is resting on, regardless of what keyboardmethod you use to change desktops (e.g. Ctrl-Alt-arrows, which pop upthe desktop selector window, vs. a keybinding which directly changesdesktops without the popup).++This is fixed in CVS, though not in a very elegant way for 2.2.xFederico - the reason it exists is because mouse focus doesn't actually maintain the ""window containing the pointer is focused"" invariant. The reason it doesn't is that to do keynav while maintaining it, you have to warp the pointer all over the place, which sucks.So the code for click to focus mode to track the active window across workspace switches still gets run to try to handle that.Of course my hack for 2.2.x basically restores the ""window containingpointer is focused"" invariant when you switch spaces, one reason itisn't quite right. I have a plan to fix it up on HEAD."

You can move the mouse around without anything happening.What you need to do first (and that's what I consider being the bug) is clicking the column headings control in order to give it the focus (there's no visual feedback for this though).I hope that I filed this bug correctly. But please correct me if this is a GTK or theme dependent bug""++I cannot reproduce this bug (not even on my ubuntu system).  Steps I used: 1. Open Nautilus. 2. Make sure right pane is in ""list mode"". 3. Click on the right pane so one of the nodes receives focus. 4. Move the mouse to a column header separator; the mouse cursor changes. 5. Press and hold left mouse button to resize the column.It works as expected (gtk+ 2.10.6-0, nautilus 2.16.1-0).Please tell me if I am trying to reproduce the bug in the right way.  If the steps above should lead to the problem I would conclude that this is not a bug in gtk+.++(I have no idea why this bug suddenly changed state).++With the same steps and the same version of GTK the first click and dnd doesn't resize the column on an Ubuntu desktop, you need to click and dnd again to actually change the column. The same happens to other applications like gnome-system-monitor++Really interesting; really cannot reproduce it here.++The same bug was described here: http://bugs.debian.org/406906 I can reproduce the same behavior on my system, in nautilus or file-roller, and as for the submitter, this happens only after opening a directory in file-roller, or unfolding it in nautilus. After that, the first attempt to resize the column always fails, and the second attempt is OK.++I played with gdb a bit.The problem is that when starting dragging, a GRAB_BROKEN event is signalled immediately canceling the dnd operation.The relevant code lies in gtktreeview.c, so it is clearly a GTK problem.The grab_broken-event has 'implicit' set to 1, 'keyboard' to 0, 'window' is bin_window and 'grab_window' is the column window that is being dragged.Hope that helps a bit.++Hi,I found the cause for the bug and I also know why Kristian Rietveld most probably couldn't reproduce it: He didn't have NumLock on.This explanation may sound weird at the first moment, but the bug lies way deeper than in gtktreeview.c as I thought initially.When you click inside the non-column-area of a GtkTreeView, GTK+ will believe there is an implicit pointer grab even after releasing all mouse buttons. Trying to resize the columns then fails. GTK+ is trying to abort the implicit grab (which it thinks is still present) by issuing a grab_broken_event.At this instant, GtkTreeView internally thinks that it is in already resizing the columns so that the grab_broken_event-handler aborts this operation.The actual bug lies in gdk/x11/gdkmain-x11.c in the function _gdk_xgrab_check_button_event(). When a button is released, it checks if there are still buttons pressed. This check is broken.It should be checked for still pressed buttons only (minus the one just released) and NOT for modifiers. On my machine, the NumLock key is  MOD2MASK (1<<4), so that the condition(xevent->xbutton.state & ~(GDK_BUTTON1_MASK << (xevent->xbutton.button - 1))) == 0)returns false. This causes that display_x11->pointer_xgrab_window is _not_ reset to NULL.A quick fix would be replacing the condition with(~0xff & xevent->xbutton.state & ~(GDK_BUTTON1_MASK << (xevent->xbutton.button - 1))) == 0)since the least 8 bits are used for modifier masks (like SHIFT, CTRL etc.) and should be ignored.++Component GDK, as has been pointed out in #bugs.FWIW, I believe I have seen this very behavior too recently. Didn't have the time to find a pattern yet, though.++(In reply to comment #7 ) > I found the cause for the bug and I also know why Kristian Rietveld most> probably couldn't reproduce it: He didn't have NumLock on.> This explanation may sound weird at the first moment, but the bug lies way> deeper than in gtktreeview.c as I thought initially.

The main problem is that the logic that was dealing with determining if an application was going away was making a comparison between a CORBA accessible and our own Python Accessible instance.  Thus, this would always fail.  The other problem is that a circular reference can sometimes happen in scripts (I'm not sure why), and that script.py had a __del__ method just for debugging purposes.  The presence of the __del__ method coupled with circular references causes the Python garbage collector to leave these objects hanging around.  By removing the script.py __del__ method (which was just there for debug purposes only), this problem is somewhat resolved.  However, I think we need to leave this bug open until we discover what is causing the circular references.++Created attachment 60512  [details]  [review] Patch that fixes the leak, but doesn't eliminate circular reference++Tracking...++Closing until we can show that there is indeed a memory leak here.

374639,GStreamer,gstreamer (core),GstTee doesn't handle pad list resyncs properly,"Please describe the problem:If we are dynamically requesting pads on a tee while the pipeline is playing, it might cause the pad list iteration to return GST_ITERATOR_RESYNC. In that case the iterations will stop before going through all the pads. This means that the return value aggregation will only include the pads up until the resync happened. The tee would therefore return the wrong gst flow message since the remaining pads could be successfull.Steps to reproduce:1. Link a few elements to a tee2. Play the pipeline3. Unlink some of the elements4. Link new elements to the tee while it is playing.Bug reproducability depends on timing (will appear if the link happens during the iteration after the unlinked pad is passed and no other successfull push happens)Actual results:tee returns an internal data flow error (-1 - unlinked) because none of the pads previous to the resync have successfully pushed.Expected results:tee should be able to deal with new pads being added dynamically. On resyncs, it should be able to try the new pad as well as the remaining pads, or at least only the remaining pads, and then return the proper gst flow message.Does this happen every time?Yes if appropriate conditions are met.Other information:++Yes, then GST_ITERATOR_RESYNC should be handled.For pad-additions a possible fix would be to add all pads a buffer has been sent into a list and clear the list after a succesful iteration. On resync those pads that are already in the list have to be skipped.For pad-removal care must be taken that the pad returned by the iterator can not be removed until the next iterator call or the end of iterator usage. That might pose some restrictions onto what one can do with pads while iterating.++a flag for each pad would be acceptable to handle the resyncs. care to make a patch?adder has some code to handle adding/removing pads while paused/playing.++I could not find any of such code in adder or in collectpads.I think it should be like thispad-addition:  remember pads that we went through already and do not push onto them again,  loop on resync  can we attach some flags on pads (g_object_set_qdata) or do we add  a list to PushDataFor this I don't yet have a solution.pad-removal:  this is critical, if pad_push() in the IteratorFoldFunction goes on a pad  that is going to be removed. The problem is the race between the point  when the iterator returns the pad and the earliest point in the  IteratorFoldFunction (where we could lock the pad)++Phillipe:Could you write a test case that we can put into the test suite?

It would be good to determine whether yourexperience is this side effect or not.++For what it's worth, the ""restrict ROI to source area"" workaround/fix ingnopernicus is not necessary with gnome-mag HEAD anymore, I fixed gnome-mag sothat requests to obtain pixels outside of the source bounds return blank(background-colored) pixels.  So as long as gnopernicus now sets the sourcebounds when not in fullscreen mode, gnopernicus will no longer need to disallowcentering on points ""near the edge"" of the source area.++> Would you please verify that this happens when the mouse is in> the leftmost third of the screen (and magnification is in> half-screen mode, the magnified view on the right half of the> screen)? The problem still occurs. 'Centered' mode is non-functional.++I tried  to recreate this problem and I found 2 cases :  -in both cases the zoomer placement was :  Left: 	756 Top : 	60 Right: 	1000 Bottom: 300   Case 1: The Zoomer options dialog is on the left side of the screen. In this case ""Centered"" mode seems to be working  ok.  Case 2: The zoomer Options dialog is on the right side of the screen. In this case ""Centered"" mode doesn't work properly.  I think this is because gnopernicus needs to set the source bounds (see Bill's comment), now that gnome-mag changed, and when that will be done I think that Focus Tracking ""Centared"" will work again. I will keep investigating.++Dragan:If gnopernicus isn't setting the source bounds, but setting the source boundsfixes the problem, then there may be a gnome-mag bug here.  gnome-mag shouldinitialize the source bounds to the ""entire source screen bounds"" when itstarts, unless it starts in halfscreen mode (in which case it should initializesource bounds to the correct half of the screen).  Can you do a 'get' on thesource bounds in gnopernicus before making this call, to help diagnose the issue?++The only time gnopernicus calls ""get_source"" is when it starts gnome-mag. At this moment the source screen is on the right half of the screen and the target is on the left half. The target changes when the zoomer placement is changed and ends up to have zoomer placement values. Even though gnopernicus can't change the source (at the moment), the source DOES change somewhere in gnome mag. I did a ""get_source"" after gnopernicus calls ""set_target"" end the source is ""the entire source screen bounds"". So in the end, the source_bounds are ""entire source screen bounds"" and the target_bounds are the zoomer placement values.++When gnopernicus calls ""get_source"" (when it initializes gnome-mag), the values of the source_bounds are kept, to be used later. But if the source_bound change at some time, gnopernicus will not use these new values because it doesen't have them. I think a fix in gnopernicus would be to call get_source everytime the values of source_bounds are used. But it could also be a bug in gnome-mag (maybe gnome-mag can start with the source_bounds to be the ""entire souce screen size"" instead of changing it afterwards.)++Hi Dragan: Are you saying that the bounds from gnopernicus' original""get_source"" query are used by gnopernicus to constrain the setROI calls?Using gnome-mag from HEAD, that shouldn't be necessary (or, at least, theconstraint should for 'centered mode' shouldn't be as strict as it was in the2.6 version).  But if you want to keep track of the source bounds, you don'tneed to call it every time you want to use source bounds; it will only changewhen source or target display change, or when explicitly changed by gnopernicus. I believe the logic in gnome-mag is correct.++Yes, you're right. I will submit a patch In witch the constraint to ROI is removed and the get_source is called everytime set_target is called.++Created attachment 27357  [details]  [review] proposed patchThis patch works for me.Please test it.++PING: Patrick, any word on results from Dragan's patch?++we don't have agreement on this patch, so please do not apply yet.

346609,gtk+,Backend: Quartz,[PATCH] Quartz backend has no support for one-button mice,"Please describe the problem:Many Macs have mice with only one button, but Gtk expects (at least) three. Many Gtk apps depend heavily on the third/right mouse button, and are nearly impossible to use with only the first/left button. Apple's convention is to hold down the control key while left-clicking to emulate a right-click, and the quartz backend should follow this convention.Steps to reproduce:1. Attach a one-button mouse to your computer2. Copy some text from any application to the clipboard3. Run tests/testtext4. Attempt to paste the text, by control-clicking to popup a context menu.Actual results:There exists no apparent way to paste the text.Expected results:The context menu pops up, and ""Paste"" can be chosen.Does this happen every time?YesOther information:The patch interprets any left-mouse-button action with control held to be a right-mouse-button action. Unfortunately, control-left-click is commonly used in GTK for multiple selection. But happily, command-click (meta-click) is usually used on the Mac for multiple selection, and is rarely used is GTK--so we can safely interpret command-left-click as control-left-click.No solution is provided for middle-clicks, which are needed much more rarely than left- or right-clicks. It would be possible to add support for middle-click emulation if this becomes an issue, using some esoteric combination like command-option-click.Some applications and their users may require the use of meta-click, so a #define is provided in gdkevents-quartz.c to allow mouse button emulation to be enabled or disabled when GTK is compiled. It might be better for this to be some sort of runtime option instead.++Created attachment 68379  [details]  [review] Patch to enable mouse button emulation++I wonder if maybe we should take another approach and make the builtin widgets that have context menus handle ctrl-click instead of doing it globally?++Whatever we do here should probably be coordinated with the desires oftouchscreen-mode people. A touchscreen is a lot like a one-button mouse,from some perspectives...++I do think it's appropriate to do this at the GDK level, rather than by changing individual widgets. I'd rather change one place in GDK than dozens of standard widgets--and this way custom widgets get support for free. There may be the rare widget which considers meta-click meaningful and does not want to have it remapped, I'm not sure if there's any good way to let a widget opt-out...There is indeed a sort of similarity with touchscreens. It looks like libgtkstylus would work on the Quartz GDK with a couple of smallish changes. Unfortunately, the conventions that touchscreens and OS X have for how right-clicks should be emulated are different, and widgets which work well with one won't necessarily work well with the other.++Another way to reproduce this: use an application which has certain command available only in the context menu without a keyboard shortcut, get used to that nice command in that nice application, take my mac laptop and try to use that application. Guys, please please please fix this! It at most may be left to the application to decide if it wants mac behavior or not; user needs the Control-Click!++It's not just a matter of hard coding control click to a right-click, that will mess up things that already use control-click (selection in treeviews, gimp, etc). Feel free to come up with a solution that doesn't break those cases.++Command-click for selection, like everywhere, no? I don't understand what you're saying, by that reasoning Gtk applications must use Control-C for Copy because they already use Control-C for Copy.++Created attachment 109973  [details]  [review] Patch to enable mouse button emulationSame patch, fixed up for current Gtk.++(In reply to comment #7 ) > Command-click for selection, like everywhere, no?

But as the> original comment says, those might be very rare. But they can't really use Command right now, right? Since Command is really Alt, so they really use Alt and everything is broken, no? I would think that maintaining compatibility in this case is not something Gtk is committed to :) > One thing we should do before or in combination with this is to swap meta and> alt, they are currently mixed up. This one really puzzled me. Option key is ignored right now, and Command is mapped to MOD1 which is Alt. What's going to be Command, GDK_MOD_SOMETHING? It'd be very nice to add GDK_COMMAND constant too.++The plan is to make command map to meta and alt to mod1. This should make things map quite well to X, so most apps will work well without modifications.Doing that in combination with a key bindning theme that remaps ctrl-[xcv] to meta-[xcv] for editable widgets will make things work quite well I think.Regarding the patch here, there is one concern left. The current event handling makes sure that we behave like X when it comes to the modifier state in the various events, and changing this looks like it could easily break that. A good test case here is gimp which makes heavy use of the state and relies on it behaving correctly. I can try to test the patch and see how it works. Can't promise when though.++Created attachment 109991  [details]  [review] Remap alt/metaSlightly related to this bug, a patch that does the mentioned change of modifiers.++Doesn't command map (more or less) to Alt in the PC world? It's the primary modifier key and immediately to the left of the spacebar, right? For historical reasons, ""Alt"" in GTK+ is represented by GDK_MOD1_MASK.For Option, there has been convergence on mapping the ""Windows"" key to Super, so  I would suggest using GDK_SUPER_MASK for that.++(In reply to comment #13 ) > Doesn't command map (more or less) to Alt in the PC world? It's the primary> modifier key and immediately to the left of the spacebar, right? Isn't the ""primary modifier key"" in the PC world Control?Command is physically in the same place as Alt, but is used for a completely non-overlapping set of functionality:                           Mac              LinuxActivate Menu Item         Command+key      Control+keySingle-select              Command+click    Control+clickActivate Context Menu      Control+click    Right clickEmacs/readline ""C-x""       Control+x        Control+x(*)Emacs/readline ""M-x""       Option+x(*)      Alt+x(*)Non-ASCII chars            Option+key       Alt-Gr+keyActivate Menu              -                Alt+key(*) == in some apps / optionally, if you want to lose some of its standard functionalitySo mapping Command to Alt is nice from a ""make your finger memory transfer easily from Linux to Mac"" perspective, but not from a ""make GTK apps on OS X behave like native apps"" perspective.++You are right about the mapping being more that way (take the edit *-x,*-c,*-v shortcuts), but isn't trying to do this level of translation automatically a bad idea? It's a pretty confusing programmer interface if: Control => GDK_MOD1_MASK Command => GDK_CONTROL_MASKI think. And you could imagine weirdness in user interfaces too ... like the GIMP tips in the status bar ""Hold down control to ..""We could possibly an extra ""virtual modifier"", so that: GDK_ACCELERATOR_MASK => set for control or command depending on platform And clued-in programmers could use that instead of GDK_CONTROL_MASK for menu shortcuts. I don't know how you handle user interface strings with that (other than %s gdk_get_accelerator_key_name()), but at least the programmer is in charge..++I think the best way to make GTK+ apps feel native on mac is to have:Command key -> metaControl key -> controlOption key -> mod1+ providing stock shortcuts using command on mac, either by providing a mac binding rc file or by changing the source to use a platform dependant macro for the modifier.Trunk already has the keys mapped like above. The problem is that the input methods currently filter out everything with mod1 which makes it impossible to enter things that need the option key like @ on some layouts. There is another bug report that deals with that that I can't find right now, searching seems to take forever.For the input method issue, I was thinking about having an GDK_INPUT_ACCELERATOR_MASK which would be control on linux/win32 and control|mod1 on mac. Or perhaps try to figure out why the filtering is done in the first place, it's not quite clear to me.++What's the reasoning? The best explanation I can come up with for your suggestion:  Command is mapped to Meta as to make sure that it never interferes with any accelerators people have assigned in their app. (Meta is pretty much entirely unused in GTK+ programs) Option is mapped to MOD1 so that all the accelerators (or mnemonics) that people do have in their apps are accessible in some fashion. Can you give a code pointer for what you are talking about about input methods?++Command is mapped to meta to leave room for moving accels from control to command.Option is mapped to mod1 because it is a modifier used to produce extra symbols on the keyboard (so it's not just used for accelerators).Here's the input method problem, I remembered it slightly wrongly but it still is relevant: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=531599 ++> Option is mapped to mod1 because it is a modifier used to produce extra symbols> on the keyboard (so it's not just used for accelerators). that doesn't make any sense. MOD1 is Alt not AltGr. (Are there PC keyboard layouts where Alt produces alternate symbols? That would seem to conflict with normal usage of Alt.)I can't make heads or tails of that gtkimcontextsimple.c bit of code.... but basically you'll have to decide whether Option should act like Alt or AltGr. ""Both"" seems problematic.++(In reply to comment #19 ) > > Option is mapped to mod1 because it is a modifier used to produce extra symbols> > on the keyboard (so it's not just used for accelerators).> > that doesn't make any sense. MOD1 is Alt not AltGr. (Are there PC keyboard> layouts where Alt produces alternate symbols? That would seem to conflict with> normal usage of Alt.) Yes, ignore that part, I got it backwards. I actually wanted to say that option corresponds to alt, but also has to be used as alt-gr. > I can't make heads or tails of that gtkimcontextsimple.c bit of code.... but> basically you'll have to decide whether Option should act like Alt or AltGr.> ""Both"" seems problematic. It's how things work with native mac apps though.++It should be noted that the Option key actually has Alt written on it as well, this has been the case for years: http://2aday.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/apple-bt-keyboard.jpg .Stepping back and looking at everything from greater distance, I think the essential problem is that we're trying to decide ""what key should correspond to what other key"", rather than ""what key(s) should accomplish which role(s)"". A macro like GDK_ACCELERATOR_MASK was already suggested. Why not take that further, at least in the long-term?GDK_ACCELERATOR_MASK1: Primary accel key, Ctl on Lin/Win, Cmd on MacGDK_ACCELERATOR_MASK2: Secondary accel key, Alt/OptionGDK_EXTEND_SELECTION_MASK: Ctl/CmdGDK_POPUP_MENU_MASK: nothing on Lin/Win, Ctl on Macetc.This way we don't have to argue about ""how can Option be Alt if it's also AltGr?"". Each key is just in a set of roles.++(In reply to comment #21 ) > GDK_ACCELERATOR_MASK1: Primary accel key, Ctl on Lin/Win, Cmd on Mac> GDK_ACCELERATOR_MASK2: Secondary accel key, Alt/Option> GDK_EXTEND_SELECTION_MASK: Ctl/Cmd> GDK_POPUP_MENU_MASK: nothing on Lin/Win, Ctl on Mac Incidentally, there are linux applications, too, which make use of Ctrl when there is only one mouse button available.++Created attachment 121370  [details]  [review] mac ctrl and cmd keysAbove two patches combined, working with svn trunk.By the way, Qt maps Command key to CONTROL enum, Control key to META, and it works pretty well. (And ctrl-click is seen as right-click by the program)++In MonoDevelop, we allow arbitrary user-specified keybindings. This means that we can deal with the command/control issues simply by having a custom keybinding scheme for Macs. Automated mapping of Command to control will just make things harder for us.Sometimes (usually?) on Linux, shift turns the alt key into the meta key. In order to bind ""Shift-Alt"" as such, instead of confusingly calling it ""Shift-Meta"", we have mapped meta back to alt.The problem with this is that our Mac users are unable to bind command (meta) independently of alt.Is there a sane solution to this?Is there a good reason for not mapping Command/Apple as Super/Windows, for consistency with other systems?++Is there a way to separate the support for CTRL+Click from the support for mapping of meta-keys?1) Handle CTRL+Click in the quartz event generation and alter the button id to that of a right click2) Support Command+{c,v,x} in GtkEntry and other text widgets (perhaps through the gtkrc as Richard provided in #530351).Then we can at least get reasonable support for these out in 2.18 while deferring how we should handle trying to map shortcuts.++This bug is fixed by the recent work in both master, gtk-3-2 and gt-2-24,the attached patch is obsolete."

334924,orca,general,atspi.py cache is not always in sync with backing objects,"In working with doing the spell checking script for GEdit today, Rich noticed that the cached name of a label appears to remain the same even if the name of the real label changes.  More specifically, he noticed that the issues he was seeing went away when he set ""CACHE_VALUES = False"" in atspi.py.  We need to either check to see if CACHE_VALUES is a worthwhile thing to keep in the code and/or why the cache is not being kept in sync.++Rich - do you remember the exact things that were going on here so we can dig into this deeper?++You should be able to recreate this problem, by spell checkinga document in gedit, which has two or more different mistakes.If you have CACHE_VALUES set to True, Orca won't speak the secondand subsequent ones correctly.If I remember correctly, gedit changes a label in the gedit spellcheck dialog that the Orca gedit scripts want to read. WithCACHE_VALUES = True, it's picking up the cached value for that label that is out of date.++Created attachment 63730  [details]  [review] Patch to do lazy caching of values and to use settings.cacheValues settingThe problem appeared to be that we could not keep the cache up to date as actively as we had wished (i.e., using the event any_data).  So, rather than doing this, we just lazily keep the cache up to date - when we detect something has changed, we just delete the local cached value.  Then, when we next need it, we round trip to retreive it.++Fixed in the development version. The fix will be available in the next major release. Thank you for your bug report."
346603,gtk+,Backend: Quartz,[PATCH] Context menus only work once,"Please describe the problem:After a context menu is dismissed, further attempts to use a menu (context or otherwise) results in the menu failing to appear. This occurs because no grab-broken event is sent after the context menu is dismissed.Steps to reproduce:1. Run tests/testtext2. Right-click on the text view--a context menu appears.3. Dismiss the menu either by choosing a menu item or clicking outside the menu.4. Right-click again on the text view--no menu appears.5. Click on the ""File"" menu in the menu bar--no menu appears.Actual results:No menus appear after the first context menu dismissal.Expected results:Menus continue to appear.Does this happen every time?Yes.Other information:Patch (to be attached) sends grab-broken events when a grab interrupts a previous grab. The X11 backend  also sends grab-broken when a window is hidden or destroyed, do we need that in quartz as well?++Created attachment 68375  [details]  [review] Patch to gdkevents-quartz.c++Created attachment 68436  [details]  [review] Patch that works with paned containersWoops, the earlier patch broke GtkPaned containers, by trying to send a grab-broken event when an implicit grab on the sizer turns into an explicit grab. New patch works with GtkPaned, and still allows context menus to work.++Thanks, this also appears to make menus in general work a bit better. (There are still problems where a submenu will grab focus and moving the mouse over the parent menu or menu bar doesn't ""re-grab"".)I've committed this, thanks again.++I've tried to make it send a grab broken event  also when the app loses focus, since now we leave menus up when minimizing the window, or focusing another app. I didn't get the menus to pop down by doing this but I will look some more at what happens.++If you'd care to post your code, I'll see if I can help :-)  Note that the X11 backend works in a way I didn't expect. I thought the click would cause a grab-broken event, and then the menu would pop down in response. But instead it seems that the click causes the menu to destroy itself, which then causes the grab-broken event. Hopefully we don't have to emulate this strange behavior.While we're on the topic, here's another problem with context menu pop-downs:1. Run gtk-demo 2. Open the Button Boxes demo3. Invoke a context menu in the main gtk-demo window by right-clicking in the content area of the ""Info"" tab (you may have to move the Button Boxes window out of the way).4. Try to dismiss the context menu by clicking back to the Button Boxes window. If you click on a button, the menu pops down. But if you click on a label or background, it doesn't pop down. It looks like the event mask is being compared against the place where you click, and not the pointer grab window.In find_window_for_event(), we're testing 'if (_gdk_quartz_pointer_grab_window && !pointer_grab_owner_events)', so in this case where owner_events is true we don't do the special-case for pointer events. Something about that must be the problem, but I honestly don't understand owner_events very well so I'm not sure how to fix it.++Created attachment 69262  [details]  [review] Attempt at getting onfocusing workingThis is what I experimented with. The events are fired off but doesn't seem to have any effect.++[ Sorry, I haven't read this in detail, just responding to a small partof comment #5 ]I think trying to fool around with the grab mechanism in random ways totry and make menus ""work"" is a mistake. Most systems *don't* have anythingequivalent to X (and thus GDK) grabs. E.g, when you say:  I thought the click would cause a grab-broken event, and then the menu   would pop down in response. But instead it seems that the click causes   the menu to destroy itself, which then causes the grab-broken event.   Hopefully we don't have to emulate this strange behavior.The only thing that could possibly be considered strange there is if you consider ""grabs"" to be part of menus. Grabs are completely indepedentand unrelated to focus in X.I've long argued that GtkMenu for Win32 and apparently for OS X as wellneeds a second mode of operation where it *doesn't* grab and deactivatesthe menu when the application loses focus.(Compare GTK+/Motif/etc. menus on X to Win32 menus and you'll find that onX when click away from a menu the click is eaten and on Win32 whenyou click away, the click is processed by other different app.)++Just FYI, Mac OS X also eats clicks when you click away from a menu.++Richard, your patch works if the calls to generate_grab_broken_event() use NULL for the last parameter."

346605,gtk+,Backend: Quartz,[PATCH] Modifier-key events are not sent,"GDK backends should send GDK_BUTTON_PRESS and GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE events when modifier keys are pressed and released, but quartz only sends these events when non-modifier keys are pressed. Clients which expect these events (such as GtkImSimpleContext) get confused.Steps to reproduce:1. Run tests/testtext2. Focus on the text view.3. Hold down shift and control.4. Continue holding down shift and control, and press the 'U' key to enter Unicode entry mode. Notice the underlined-u appearing in the text view, to indicate the new entry mode.5. Still holding shift and control, enter the text ""40"" to indicate U+0040 COMMERCIAL AT. The text appears after the 'u', also underlined.6. Release the shift and control keys.Expected result:The underlined 'u40' disappears, and is replaced by the @ symbol.Actual result:The text 'u40' remains, and messages such as the following appear on the console:2006-07-05 01:31:42.103 testtext[25380] Unhandled event NSEvent: type=FlagsChanged loc=(-101,625) time=148034.9 flags=0x100 win=0x169aee0 winNum=13999 ctxt=0x17913 keyCode=59The attached patch uses the NSFlagsChanged event to detect modifier key pressed and released events. It also adds debugging of key events when --gdk-debug=events is passed at the command line.The X11 backend appears to always pair press and release events, but this implementation does not. For example, if the user holds down Alt while in the Finder, switches to a GTK app, and then releases Alt, only the release event will be received by GTK. Any apps that depend on the exact behavior of the X11 backend could misbehave. Is this a significant problem with the patch?++Created attachment 68377  [details]  [review] Patch to enable modifier-key events++Created attachment 68540  [details]  [review] Fixed patchApparently flags-changed events are sent when an Exposé keyboard shortcut is used, although the keycode in these events is zero and appears to be meaningless. I'm not really sure what Apple was thinking when they decided this!Anyhow, the new patch properly ignores these events.++Thanks, I've committed this. The potential problem that you mention could be an issue but we can deal with the corner cases in later iterations.Are you sure that the gtk app being switched to receives a key press event if alt is being pressed and then the gtk app is focused?++At least in X11 on OS X, that seems to be the behavior. Some sort of phantom events seem to be sent in order to ensure that there's always (or at least usually) exactly one press per release. It probably has more to do with the keyboard driver for X11 than with anything in GDK. Try it yourself with GDK_DEBUG=events if you want to be sure I'm not imagining it!Thanks for taking a look at my patches, I appreciate it.

The bug was due to a %s instead of a %d in a printf statement in the applied patch. I also changed a %d to a %ld for a time_t printf() parameter, as time_t is a long and on some architectures long != int.The patch is based off the latest SVN version, so it assumes that the previous patch is already applied.There are still some warnings about signed vs. unsigned chars, but I've left them alone as they don't seem to be harming anything right now.++Just as an aside, should d(x) still be defined? It may be helpful to developers, but most users don't want to see that information and unnecessary printf() statements really hurt performance.We could leave it in the development version only, but that means when the next stable version is released, someone would have to remember to turn it off.++Please commit to head.++Committed to head.

320745,gnome-applets,mixer,Keyboard volume control does not work when applet slider is showing,"Version details: 2.10.2Distribution/Version: Debian UnstableAfter clicking on the volume control applet to the single Master slider is shownas a kind of popup, the keyboard-bound volume control buttons don't work. Afterclosing the slider by choosing a volume or clicking away the keyboard controlswork again. The volume control buttons work fine when the full Volume Controlwindow is open.Steps to reproduce:1. Click on volume control applet.2. Press keyboard-bound volume control button.Experienced behaviour:  Volume does not change.Expected behaviour:  Volume should change and the slider be updated ""live"" (as with the Masterchannel when the full Volume Control window is open).++Created attachment 56115  [details]  [review] possible fix (with some side-effects, read below)I see this too.Possibly, this is related to the fact that we grab inputs when we show the volume slider dock. OS X doesn't do this, for example. I also see that menus don't forward such key events either. However, non-input grabbers such as the clock applet work fine...The attached patch removes the input grabbing, which makes the applet behave like the OS X applet, and this makes the shortcut keys work fine also. In addition, it fixes a ""bug"" that the applet would accept statekeys when pressing up/down to change volume, which shouldn't happen... Some people may disagree, though. The change in behaviour is interesting, and some people may like it whereas others may not... I think the OS X mixer applet, in addition, also hides after having changed the volume through sliding, which is sometimes annoying and sometimes exactly what you want.All in all, I tend to think that this new OS X-like behaviour is interesting, and some people may like it, but I tend to dislike it more than the current behaviour, so I may end up looking for alternatives to make the shortcut keys work...++I like the way we click off to hide it.++I asked in #gtk+ today, and got two suggestions:- work out a client-server message protocol for metacity for event forwarding (DND/alt-tab has the same issue, and therefore there's an interest in this)- temporarily release keyboard grab on outside events, send again, and regrab keyboard after thatI'll have a look at both and see which sucks less in the next while.++Ronald,Could we simply listen for those keystrokes and make the slider move without popping up the dialog? People will still get visual indication from the slider itself.May be a useful workaround.++Probably; good idea...++The code has recently been rewritten and the keyboard grab no longer occurs. Ot works for me, so I'll close it unless someone can reproduce it in a 2.23 series gnome-applets."

This is misleading, because the indentation is the other way around. Similarly, if I'm dealing with someone's insanely-indented code with many assorted tabs and spaces intermixed, Orca's indentation-speaking algorithm only counts the number of spaces and tabs.It would be better if Orca spoke the spaces and tabs as they are intermingled, so ""2 tabs 3 spaces 1 tab"" would help me to correctly fix someone's code.++Thanks Nolan!  Can you work up a patch for us?  :-)++Created attachment 128121  [details]  [review] rev 1This seems to implement the requested functionallity for me, Please test.pylinted to 10.00++I'm curious about people's thoughts about the new behavior.  The issue I have is that even the new behavior can result in misleading information because of the way the tab character works.For example, assume I have a tab indent of 8 spaces (the typical norm).  Now, assume I press the space key 6 times and then press tab.  The indent is still going to be at 8.  So, any of these end up with the same indent:16 spaces5 spaces 2 tabs1 tab 3 spaces 1 tab6 spaces 1 tab 1 space 1 tabBut, I guess in real-world use cases, people are most likely to end up prefixing their lines with tabs and then adding spaces for extra indent.  So, the new behavior will end up being perhaps less misleading than the existing behavior.Mike, what are your thoughts on the new behavior?++I think presenting the line as it is given to us is important, because editors do provide configurable tab widths, and making an assumption at the orca level could create problems.At least this way the user knows exactly what chars are on the line, and can (as you, and Nolan) said fix it by hand.``so ""2 tabs 3 spaces 1 tab"" would help me to correctly fix someone's code.``We dont really have any other plausable alternative, that wouldnt be based on guessing or assuming. The line as stored in the file would be ""\t\t   \t"" in the case of ""2 tabs 3 spaces 1 tab"", and this is what we are presenting.++OK - I'm good with this change for both trunk and gnome-2-24 if Mike is good with it.++I'm also good with this change as it is indeed more accurate.++Thanks everyone, especially Jon!

What distro are you on, and how did you install Tomboy 0.9.4?++I was the one who installed it (on ubuntu gutsy), by running:  ./configure --prefix=/home/shweta/cutting-edge-tomboy/install  make  make install  /home/shweta/cutting-edge-tomboy-install/bin/tomboyLooking at the backtrace more closely -- ew, I see what you mean, it seems to be picking up the libraries from the system-installed tomboy 0.8.mumble.Okay, so why is it not looking in --prefix for its libraries?  How can one fix that?  And if the addin interface is changing, why isn't there some versioning on it?++Something in ~/.tomboy/addin* is probably pointing to the system addins location.  Try deleting that (it will cause you to lose your settings for whether or not certain addins are enabled), and see if the problem goes away.I'm dropping the severity to normal.  Feel free to change if you disagree. :-)++Setting the default assignee and QA Contact to "" tomboy-maint@gnome.bugs "".++Just FYI, I can fix this by hand-editing the ~/.tomboy/addins/Tomboy.addins file.  I don't recommend doing this, though.++I'm marking as critical...and really must fix by Monday.  Perhaps there is something hacky we can do, like setting using a gconf key to determine first run with 0.9.x/0.10.x, and on that first run delete ~/.tomboy/addin*?I think a lot of people are going to experience this problem.++So, as far as I can tell, there are two real problems here:1) Trying to load 0.8-era plugins with 0.9-era Tomboy breaks horribly.The correct solution to this would seem to require some sort of versioning with the plugin interfaces themselves?2) Tomboy likes to write out its install path to ~/.tomboy/Tomboy.addins.  This breaks running Tomboy from multiple different installs at different places -- if you have two installs of Tomboy, at least one of them will fail to find their plugins.The correct solution to this would seem to be, instead of writing out the addins path to ~/.tomboy/Tomboy.addins, just internally append the compiled-in addin install path to the addin search path (in addition to whatever might be in ~/.tomboy/Tomboy.addins, so users can still install their own addins to a directory in their home dir.  Well, or just add another search path like ~/.tomboy/addins/ and stop using Tomboy.addins altogether).--I don't really understand how deleting ~/.tomboy/*.addins when first upgrading to 0.9-era Tomboy will fix either of these bugs.  It seems to only help with the much more specific case where both bugs are triggered at once because the user installed a new version of Tomboy to a local path and left the old version installed in the system path.++Nathaniel, I think you're spot on with (1).  There is versioning there, so I think we might be able to implement this without too much trouble.  This might make it look like a user has NO addins available, though.Not sure how far we can go with (2), as a lot of our addin configuration stuff is determined by our use of the Mono.Addins framework.  Definitely worth looking into, though.The proposed hacky fix would not really work for people who are doing parallel installs; you're right about that.  It would, at least, be a decent fix for people who are just upgrading their distro.  Alternatively, we could be a little smarter and just always check for the right path in Tomboy.addins, which should work (though it would cause folks to lose enabled/disabled settings).Thanks for the brainstorming...I'll look into this very soon.++I suppose I was assuming that if you upgrade your distro-provided Tomboy, then you will also upgrade your distro-provided plugins, too, and there will be no problem.  It's when there's version skew between the default-plugin-dir-string compiled into Tomboy and the actual contents of that dir that problems arise, and distros should generally keep those in sync.++Is there a call in Mono.Addins that we can just call at startup to have it reread/rebuild everything?  Although, that wouldn't really help out our startup time.  Hmm.++Created attachment 106445  [details]  [review] Quick fix patch to stop Tomboy from looking at the old addins dir.This fix rewrites ~/.tomboy/addins every time Tomboy runs (instead of only rewriting when the file doesn't exist).  This seems to fix the problem.Once this fix is in, parallel installs should be better supported (for 0.10.0 and greater).  However, preferred addins seem to be path-specific, so if you had the bugzilla addin on in 0.x.y, and switch to 0.a.b (installed somewhere else), the bugzilla addin will no longer be enabled, and you'll lose your cute bugzilla links.  Just FYI.I'm not committing just yet...and, I am going to look into making Tomboy only load addins that require that major version of Tomboy (that way Tomboy would never try to even load 0.8.x-era addins).++Committed in r1928.I also modified Tomboy.addin.xml to specify that it was not backward-compatible, but Mono.Addins appears to merely warn in this situation. An old addin can still be loaded and cause Tomboy problems.At this point, the only remaining problem is that a user could have an old/incompatible addin in ~/.tomboy/addins that could cause similar issues.  This should be a fairly rare situation, but I'm leaving the bug open.We need to be able to not load addins that depend on the wrong Tomboy addin version.Downgrading from critical to major because of the reduced impact.++I may just be tired, but I couldn't get the versioning working the way I wanted without tweaking Mono.Addins.  I think this bug is no longer a blocker on 0.10.0, but it would be nice to finish up for 0.10.1.  Thoughts?Chances are I will have no time to address this (or any other bugs) before hard code freeze hits tomorrow.++Created attachment 106498  [details]  [review] Upgrade addin's config.xml to allow user addin prefs to work in newer Tomboy++(In reply to comment #14 ) > Created an attachment (id=106498) [edit]> Upgrade addin's config.xml to allow user addin prefs to work in newer Tomboy> Committed this to SVN Trunk (r1930)."

113551,pango,indic,Bugs in the Bengali rendering system of Pango.,"Hello,Thanks for the work on the Bengali rendering in Pango. However, there are a few bugs which we have come across while working onfont development and Bengali l10n.I am listing them below, and there are two screenshots - http://www.nongnu.org/freebangfont/pango_bugs/shot_bugs_gedit.jpg showingthe problem strings as rendered in Gedit2, and the other http://www.nongnu.org/freebangfont/pango_bugs/shot_bugs_yudit.jpg showingthe correct rendering via Yudit. The file used for generating thescreenshots is also downloadable from http://www.nongnu.org/freebangfont/pango_bugs/bugs.txt . (Note that I amusing Pango version 1.2.1 - the one provided with Mandrake 9.1)1. Yaphala---------------a. The string &#2479;&#2509;&#2479; is rendered incorrectly. For some reasons, the Yafala markis getting rendered twice.        More information on yaphala can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otfntdev/bengalot/features.htm (section on ""Post-base form of consonant"")b. The sequence 0985 09CD 09AF 09BE (&#2437;&#2509;&#2479;&#2494;) is not rendered properly.    I quote from the Unicode Indic FAQ.	Q: What are the Bengali characters used to transcribe the sound ""a"" (as inEnglish ""bat"") in Unicode?	A: In Bengali, the sequence ""zophola"" (U+09CD U+09AF) + the ""aa"" matra(U+09BE) is used for transcribing the 		English ""a"" in ""bat"". Thiszophola_aa can be seen as a special ""composite"" matra to write a newBengali sound, 	  imported from English. Represent these sequences using ahalant (virama):		Vowel_A_zophola_AA = 0985 09CD 09AF 09BE ( a- halant ya -aa )		Vowel_E_zophola_AA = 098F 09CD 09AF 09BE ( e- halant ya -aa )		If you need to add a candrabindu or other combining mark in the sequence,represent the sequence as:		Vowel_A_zophola_AA + candrabindu = 0985 09CD 09AF 09BE 0981 ( a- halantya -aa candrabindu )    2. Baphala---------------Pango, for some reasons is confusing between the sequence 09AC 09CD. Thissequence can be substituted by two different lookups  - pres, and blws.Examples are given below.pres - &#2460;&#2476;&#2509;&#2470; blws - &#2460;&#2509;&#2476;&#2470; I have attached a screenshot of how the above two examples look in Yudit.More details on blws can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otfntdev/bengalot/features.htm (section on Below-base substitutions)3. ZWNJ & ZWJ---------------------Rendering of certain strings have led us to believe that Pango is somehowconfusing between Zero Width Non Joiner (ZWNJ) and Zero Width Joiner (ZWJ).<consonant> <halant> <ZWJ> <consonant> is rendered in the exact same way as<consonant> <halant> <ZWNJ> <consonant>. This should not happen - as thescreenshot taken in Yudit shows. <consonant> <halant> <ZWJ> should renderthe ""half form"" of the consonant, while Pango is rendering the ""halantform"" instead (or it may be simply putting the consonant followed by thehalant - I am not very sure). This issue becomes important when we handlethe khanda-ta character in Bengali - a short write-up on this can be foundin the Unicode Indic FAQ.++Patches, are of course, much appreciated.++Created attachment 17020  [details]  [review] Patch to fix 1a++Here is a small patch for 1a. This seems like a problem with indic-ot, not just Bengali. I am not quite sure if the patch is correct for other languages but it works for Bengali, and I am hoping it will give Owen some indication about what is the real problem.++Created attachment 17022  [details]  [review] Patch to fix 1a and 2++The second patch includes the previous fix for 1a, and fix for 2.  Owen, can you please take a look at the third issue? It seems like a word with ZWJ or ZWNJ are broken into three items (in pango_itemize), and then treated alike.++I don't think the patch is quite right, having multiple postbase forms is allowed in Bengali, I believe, and yourpatch will prevent such cases from rendering correctly.See: http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/icu/source/layout/IndicReordering.cpp.diff?r1=1.8&r2=1.9 For how the problem was fixed in ICU. The immediately relevantpart of the patch is the change:- while (baseConsonant >= baseLimit) {+ while (baseConsonant > baseLimit) {But probably the other parts of the patch need to be ported to Pango as well.++I am quite sure (99%) you can't have multiple post-base in Bengali (I am not sure about other indic languages). In Bengali only 0x09AF has post-base form, and I haven't seen any word where it repeats itself. I am not sure how to test the other languages.  I'll try out what you mentioned Owen, but I doubt I can port all the changes from ICU to Pango anytime soon...++Okay, seems like there weren't too many ICU changes for the reorder function. Attached is the port of the diff you pointed out. Please take a look and see if you can come up with an official patch some time soon.  as for issue 1b, I don't think there is anything in ICU.

I have no idea if this is corrector not, though at least there are different results for thetwo sequences....(If this change is correct, then ICU needs it as well.)++U+9AC should be _bb (right now in CVS it is _bb not _cb). Reph is only for U+9B0. I am attaching two screenshots with _bb and _rb. As you can see for _rb the result is the same, which is not correct. The result should be as produced by _bb.  Also, a very quick hack (and a bit ugly) is to set U+985 to _ct from _iv, this will fix the 1b issue. I will also upload an image with the result. There is a small side effect, but I am sure everyone can live with that, instead of pango rendering it wrong.++Created attachment 17028  [details] The correct rendering result for U+9AC with _bb++Created attachment 17029  [details] The incorrect rendering result for U+9AC with _rb++Created attachment 17030  [details] fix/work around for issue 1 and 2++Created attachment 17031  [details]  [review] My version of indic-ot.c (diff -upw)++Created attachment 17032  [details]  [review] Ugly version of ICU port++Created attachment 17035  [details] Results with patch 17031 OR 17032++Owen, hmmm with patch 17031 or 17032 nothing is rendered as expected.

I really don't knowanything about Bengali, as you can tell :-). So, do wehave any idea *what* is going wrong? The output of indic_ot_reorder, with the features *not*applied is: U+99C U+9AC U+9CD U+9A6 dist  dist  dist  dist rphf  rphf  rphf  rphf bwlf              bwlf half              half pstf              pstfTracing through TT_GPOS_Apply_String, the features thattake effect are first, the middle two characters arecombined into a ra-below-base form by 'blwf', thensecond, 'blws' combines the first and second glyphs.Eric would have know better, but I'm wondering if theproblem isn't simply that the features are supposedto be applied syllable by syllable and we're doingthe whole string at once.Your issue 3. is bug 91542 .. in Pango currently, every character has to be assigned to *some* script.Is there an easy workaround short of fixing 91542?We can't assign ZWNJ to indic-fc, because it isneeded, e.g., for displaying Persian in Arabicscript, but perhaps we can add ZWJ to the list ofcharacters that indic-fc.c handles? As it turnsout, that won't work either because the Indic engineadvertises itself as one engine for each differentIndic language. So, only one Indic script canget ZWJ...So, in the end, I don't have any idea other than fixing bug 91542 .++Note that my patches above do *not* contain your workaroundfor 2, do they not work for the problem in 1a?++Two quick thoughts on 1b: Does the 'independent vowel + halant + ya + aa' combination work in Windows? The OT bengali specification strongly implies that uniscribe doesn't handle it. It should be pretty trivial to handle by adding an extra flag to scriptFlags and writing a special case for it in indic_ot_reorder().++I tried what you said, 1b does not get fixed with out the _ct hack. Let me explain this problem. Take the following input:  U+985 U+9CD U+9AF U+9BE  The problem with this is that U+985 is an independent vowel, and right now this input will become three syllables, (U+985) (U+9CD) (U+9AF U+9BE). This is not right obviously. Even if we somehow treat it as one syllable, we end up setting the tag blwf_p to all of them.  This is a very very special case for U+985 where it acts as a consonant instead of a vowel. If you want to deal with it properly then we will have to add quite a few checks for U+985 in the reorder code to add proper tags. But as indic-ot.c is used by all the indic scripts, I think it will be even a bigger hack, risk, and extra delay. As this is a pure Bengali issue, I thought it will be better to keep the hack limited to Bengali :) The only side effect for my hack is that U+985 can now take up other independent vowels, which may actually be considered as a feature :) And I don't have access to a windows box at home, don't know what windows does. Can someone else please check?  For 2, the problem is with the tags. Consider the following two inputs: U+99C U+9AC U+9CD U+9A6 U+99C U+9CD U+9AC U+9A6  After reorder, both should be (and is): U+99C U+9AC U+9CD U+9A6  The difference is in the tags. For the first case, we should have blwf_p for U+9AC U+9CD. With out the patch I proposed, pango sets blwf_p by default to everything, as result to the second case too.  As for 3, today was my first day hacking pango... no way I can make a meaningful comment on this one. The only idea that crossed my mind is to consider ZWJ as part of the language left (or right in case of LTR) to it. Most of the code in indic directory seems to be checking for CC_ZERO_WIDTH_MARK, but currently this case can not happen. I am not sure about other engines.++It seems to me that the next step for 1b is to: - Find a uniscribe enabled copy of Microsoft windows - See if 'U+985 U+9CD U+9AF U+9BE' renders as desired - Try another sequence that would make sense for a    consonant, but doesn't make sense for U+985,    say        U+985 + halant + <normal consonant>   and see how that renders.Another approach would be simply to ask on the OpenType mailing list( http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/otlist.htm )and ask for clarification of the relationship betweenthe Unicode Indic FAQ item and the Bengali OpenType spec.About 2, one concern would be a case where you have a subscript form beneath a dead consonant (C + virama + C_below + virama + C)or devanagari ra, this is described in R8 of theUnicode book's Devanagari section (Chapter is availablefor download from http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ .)R8 is specifically mentioned as applying to other subscriptconsonants for Gurmukhi in the Unicode chapter as well.So, you only want to supress blwf on the *first* consonant of the syllable, not on all pre-base consonants.So, something as simple as: gulong tag = (i == baseLimit) ? half_p : blwf_pmay be right, but I'd really like to get Eric Mader to look at this before we change things, since this affectsall Indic scripts.(This bug report supports the idea that there should be only *one* issue per bug report.)++I just looked at the Bengali part of chapter 9 of Unicode4.0. It cleary states what to do for 1b. I don't think we need to bring it up with OpenType mailing list, unless we want to know if they are planning to add some new feature in OT layout table. And IMHO if uniscribe does not render it properly then we need to let them know, not follow them :)  And your suggestion ""gulong tag = (i == baseLimit) ? half_p : blwf_p"" does work.  Issue 3 is quite important for Bengali at least. Unicode 4.0 seems to be using ZWJ/ZWNJ to deal with few commonly used cases.  btw, I just tried out Qt's OT support. It works with all these cases!++I've split this into four separate bug reports; I'll leavethis bug open to track the resolution of the four issues.++Hopefully we can fix some of the problems earlier, but fixingall of these issues won't be possible until at least 1.4.++Three of the four issues are already fix, the one remaining is in bug 118299 . Can't this bug be closed now?++Closing as per my last comment."

For visual confirmation of the squishing: http://primates.ximian.com/~aaron/img/panel-screenshot.png++I suspect that the changes I made recently tolibnpanel-applet/panel-applet.c are the cause of this bug.Three pixels were taken from the top and bottom of an applet to allowroom for focus indication to be drawn.++Well :) it is seriously horrible. It also cuts fonts and icons andlooks bad.But why does this work fine for the workspace switcher?++Is there some reason why focus indication needs to be drawn? WM themeframes are not 3 pixels wide, and they get focus indication just fine:) [Honest question- are there a11y issues if part of the panel isobscured during the actual focus action? I honestly can't think ofany, but I'm definitely not an expert.]I'm marking high, because:(1) it makes the smallest size panel completely useless(2) makes the panel appear quite ugly, with a lot of blank space(3) it doesn't solve any focus issues for either the menu panel orhidden panels.

Hope that is clear.++[ adding myself to CC ]++Please, please (sob sob), remove the padding before the 2.0.0 codefreeze!

Ithought you said it would be fixed before freeze?' And #gnome seems touniversally agree that it is pretty horrid.

A couple of things to note1) The focus indication around applets is now very poor. Its anaccessibility requirement that the focus indication is clear. To drawa decent focus indication we need to have some space around the applet- thats what the padding is for.2) The fitts law thing never worked on an edge panel. It still doesn't.++It seems we have a fairly obvious case here where a11y needs need tobe in some way optional or otherwise changeable.

584689,totem,GStreamer backend,"Should use get-{audio,video,text}-tags playbin2 actions for getting tags","Hi,currently totem gets the tags for different streams by having a bus watch and by detecting from the class of the originating element of a tag message if it is for the audio or video stream. This has some disadvantages: tags for a specific stream can also be emitted by demuxers for example, which don't have audio or video in their class. Also there currently is no way to detect if tags are for an active stream or not. (See also bug #582588 comment #3 and following).The correct way to do this is by either installing an event probe on the audio/video/text sink pads or by using the get-{audio,video,text}-tags action signals of playbin2 (which internally works by an event probe on the sink pads).To use the playbin2 actions properly in totem bug #584686 needs to be fixed first as currently there's no way to detect when tags have changed or when no new tags are added anymore.++I'm working on it now (and make sure that it still works with playbin2 0.10.23).++Created attachment 135939  [details]  [review] totem-playbin2-get-tags.diffProposed patch. This checks at the first time if playbin2 has the new signals, if not it falls back to old behaviour.If the signals are there tag messages are ignored and instead the new signals are used to detect when tags have changed. As these signals are called from a random thread it's necessary to marshal them back into the main thread by g_idle_add().Any comments or can this already be committed? ;)++I'd rather have only one codepath for that. If the next -base release is close enough, remove the old code, and bump the reqs.++The next core/base releases will be ~20th July... is this close enough?Also I noticed an issue with that patch: a) tags-changed signal handlers should only do something if the stream id is the currently selected one and b) on stream change the new tags should be get for the new stream id.I'll change the patch soon...++Isn't there any way to have a pre-release before that? That's a bit too far for that. We already bumped reqs for the last gst-plugins-base release...Feel free to commit this patch if there's no way to get a pre-release, once you're happy with it.check_playbin2_versionThere's no need for the ""first_time"" bit, we only create one bvw per program usually, so something like:if (check_playbin2_version()) {    g_signal_connect(...Please also add comments about the bits we'll remove when we up the reqs, with a FIXME in there.++A pre-release will be about 2 weeks earlier, is that early enough?++This is still more than a month away, and means that I can't expect anyone to test pre-releases of Totem, or put them in distros.++commit 6cea24030a0bd7487d7e3657ce82c2e2ebdbe8a1Author: Sebastian Dröge < sebastian.droege@collabora.co.uk >Date:   Mon Jun 8 12:16:30 2009 +0200    Use the {video,audio,text}-tags-changed signals of playbin2        2009-06-08  Sebastian Dröge  < sebastian.droege@collabora.co.uk >                * src/backend/bacon-video-widget-gst-0.10.c:            If we have playbin2 from gst-plugins-base 0.10.23.1 or newer use            the new {audio,video,text}-tags-changed signals for noticing if            tags have changed. This also gives us immediately the corresponding            stream id and the type of the stream and makes it unnecessary to            try to get the type via the tag messages' sender.

Attila++In order for this to work, I think the Orca source code might need to be modified to provide a table that maps the untranslated strings to translated strings.  These would be used for presenting the translated strings in the GUI only.For example, something like:someTable = {}# Translators: this is the size attribute for a font.# Blah blah blah.#someTable[""fontattr|size""] = Q_(""size"")# Translators: this is the name attribute for a font.# Blah blah blah.#someTable[""fontattr|family name""] = Q_(""family name"")I suspect this table may not ever be complete, but we should be able to do a relatively complete job to cover at least the strings we know about.++Will, how can help I try test this method for orca-customizations.py file, for example the space translation problem test with custom keynames my old bug?

This will first require source code modification in Orca to use the translated strings in the Orca preferences GUI.  The person assigned to this bug will first do an investigation into what is needed to fix it, propose a patch if possible, and then you can test. > attribute names translated the hungarian language?

Very good point.  It may be that text attributes need localization for both the preferences GUI and for when being presented to users via other means (e.g., Insert+f).++Created attachment 113068  [details]  [review] Revision #1.First attempt at this. I believe we are localizing in the right places:1/ The first column of the text attributes pane on the orca preferences.2/ When the user types ORCA_MODIFIER-f3/ For the where-am-i mode that gives text attributes.What's left is the best wording for some of the attributes and tomake sure we are pointing to the best URL's to provide furtherassistance. The ones which currently have ""???"" against them in particular. I could parrot what the attribute says, but it would be nice to know what values are permissible and what exactly each attribute means. I'm no text attribute expert, and the online documentation is flimsy (or well hidden) at best.++Found one so far:Font effect http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-fonts-20020802/#font-effect Confirmed by doing all sorts of crimes against nature to some text in OOo Writer.  What showed up as the font-effect seems consistent with the above.++More experimenting in Writer and comparing results and values of attributes.Pixels above lines and pixels below lines seem to be another way to say ""top margin"" and ""bottom margin"" respectively.  Why they didn't go with that when they were going with ""left margin"" and ""right margin"" I couldn't tell you.... http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/box.html#propdef-margin-top  http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/box.html#propdef-margin-bottom Paragraph style I think is going to be harder in that I don't believe there's a corresponding CSS equivalent -- unless you consider the full style itself. In OOo Writer, the paragraph styles include, but are not limited to, Default, Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3, and Text body.++text-rotation is the angle at which the text is displayed (i.e. rotated from the norm) and, at least in Writer, is represented in degrees of rotation.  The closest I found was the <angle> section here: http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-text-20030514/#glyph-orientation-horizontal scale: Haven't found anything to link to.  But the scale refers to the size of the text relative to the font size and is represented as a multiplier (a scale factor even! :-) ).  So 150% is a scale of 1.5.++Created attachment 113076  [details]  [review] Revision #2.Adjusted to incorporate suggestions from Joanie in comment #9 and comment #10 (thank you), and to adjust to use normalgettext support, rather than qualified strings (via a commentfrom Will on IRC -- thank you).++Created attachment 113079  [details]  [review] Revision #3.Joanie found a good URL: http://library.gnome.org/devel/atk/1.22/AtkText.html#AtkTextAttribute Thank you. That simplifies things quite a bit.By my reckoning, we just have ""rise"" and ""paragraph-style"" attributes left to do (which look like they are OOo specific). Also, we don't have a URL for ""writing-mode"" (another OOo specific attribute where I made a guess at what it meant).Now also pylints to 10.0 for all files.++Rise is hiding on the Atk page:ATK_TEXT_ATTR_RISENumber of pixels that the characters are risen above the baseline As for paragraph-style:  If that is indeed an OOo thing.... What about something a la:This attribute refers to the named style which is associated with the entire paragraph and which controls the default formatting (font, text size, alignment, etc.) of that paragraph. Examples of paragraph styles include Heading 1, Heading 2, Caption, Footnote, Text Body, Title, and Subtitle.++Created attachment 113080  [details]  [review] Revision #4.Thanks Joanie. Okay, I think we are close to being done.Just two without specific URLS, but the descriptions arehopefully enough.++(In reply to comment #5 ) > someTable[""fontattr|size""] = Q_(""size"")> someTable[""fontattr|family name""] = Q_(""family name"") OK - I wrote these too quickly.  They should have been:someTable[""size""] = Q_(""fontattr|size"")someTable[""family name""] = Q_(""fontattr|family name"")In case you're not familiar with the convention used, _(""some text"") is used to mark strings for direct translation.  Q_(""qualifier|some text"") is to provide some mechanism to qualify the text in case the same word might be translated differently in different contexts.  An example is the use of the word ""selected"" to describe a selected radio button and selected text.  In other languages, different words might be used.  So, we have Q_ usage in Orca:  Q_(""radiobutton|selected"")  Q_(""text|selected"")The only case I can find right now with the given patch is ""underline"".  We have ""underline"" as the spoken word for the ""_"" character and we've now introduced ""underline"" as a font attribute.  Since single words and short phrases may be likely to cause conflict down the road, I used Q_ for the example to help prevent future conflict.  At a minimum, the patch probably should use Q_ for the ""underline"" being added here.Finally, when using Q_, we usually add a ""ONLY TRANSLATE THE PART AFTER THE PIPE CHARACTER |"" line in the comment for translators.++Okay, thanks.If these are all text attributes (rather than font attributes),wouldn't:someTable[""size""] = Q_(""textattr|size"")someTable[""family name""] = Q_(""textattr|family name"")be better? I.e. ""textattr"" as the qualifier?++Adding Will's name to the summary so he doesn't miss my question.++(In reply to comment #17 ) > Okay, thanks.> > If these are all text attributes (rather than font attributes),> wouldn't:> > someTable[""size""] = Q_(""textattr|size"")> someTable[""family name""] = Q_(""textattr|family name"")> > be better?

Thanks your hard work.Attila++Tried the last attached patch. The attribute names translatable correctly! But another problem, the attribute values not translatable yet.

Thanks,Attila++Thanks Attila.Will, do we need to create another translation table for all thepossible attribute values as well?

Yep - the _("""") and Q_("""") stuff works this way.  If there's no translation available, you get the original string back.  That's why we sometimes see English mixed in interfaces when working with locales other than English: the translation is incomplete.++> Are you able to obtain the> list of possible attribute values?

652407,orca,magnification,Orca's enableMagnifier setting should be based on the value of screen-magnifier-enabled,Currently Orca has its own setting to enable or disable magnification. This was needed back when we did not have a stand-alone magnification solution in GNOME. But now we do have such a solution (gnome-shell mag). And this solution can be enabled or disabled via the Universal Access menu as well as the Universal Access settings dialog. Orca users who need magnification should enable it via the UA methods instead of through Orca. And Orca should look to the the value of screen-magnifier-enabled to determine if magnification is being used (i.e. for the purpose of focus and caret tracking for keyboard users whilst we await for that to be implemented in gnome-shell mag).++http://git.gnome.org/browse/orca/commit/?id=44577e6fe600aaf2bce5a0746b491dfb6c623d93

341802,evolution,general,Make Evolution installed directories names without version,"Please describe the problem:Our first concern here is: We notice that there are severalversioned-directories installed by Evolution in /usr/include, /usr/liband /usr/share,like /usr/lib/evolution-data-server-1.2, /usr/include/evolution-2.6. Weunderstand that this is thus designed to accommodate coexistence ofmultiple version. However, we think there is another possible solution to make coexistenceof multiple versions possible, and which is better as far as we areconcerned. Like what we have done with the evolution libs in /usr/lib(they are all put in to /usr/lib/evolution/$version-number insteadof /usr/lib/evolution-$version-number). In this way, all this files canbe placed in directories that easily get cluttered. For example, in our opinion this is good:   /usr/share/evolution/1.x/   /usr/share/evolution/2.x/This is bad   /usr/share/evolution-1.x   /usr/share/evolution-2.xIt is bad because this clutters up a directory (/usr/share) that manydifferent projects install to.  If a project installs version numberedstuff, they should install it to private locations that are specificto the application (such as /usr/share/evolution).The current status of Evolution installed directories are: /usr/lib/evolution/2.x/usr/libexec/evolution/2.x/usr/share/evolution/2.xand /usr/include/evolution-2.6              =>/usr/include/evolution/2.6/usr/include/evolution-data-server-1.6=>/usr/include/evolution-data-server/1.6/usr/include/libgtkhtml-3.8             =>/usr/include/libgtkhtml/3.8/usr/include/libsoup-2.2                =>/usr/include/libsoup/2.2/usr/lib/evolution-data-server-1.2      =>/usr/lib/evolution-data-server/1.2/usr/share/evolution-data-server-1.6=>/usr/share/evolution-data-server/1.6Our proposal is to change all those in second part into those after the""=>"", so that better consistency can be achieved.

Packages that don't use pkg-config are broken anyway.Note that I'm leaving library names alone.  This is for directories only.++I've had a change of heart about the Evolution library directory.  The libraries there don't use libtool versioning and have no backward compatibility guarantees, so the version number in the path is the only clue you have as to whether they're are compatible with 3rd party software.I'm still in favor of dropping the rest of the version-numbers, including Evolution's data directory.++As far as i can tell, only evolution is affected these days (gtkhtml has an API version in /usr/share/ included, which should be fine and conform with glib-2.0 an similar).I see currently in evolution:   /usr/lib/evolution/3.14/   /usr/include/evolution-3.14/   /usr/libexec/evolution/3.14/   /usr/share/evolution/3.14/while them all can have dropped the 3.14 from the names/folders.++Created commit b05e2a5 in evo master (3.13.6+) [1][1] https://git.gnome.org/browse/evolution/commit/?id=b05e2a5"

614062,gdm,general,Timed Login is broken,"Created attachment 157231  [details]  [review] patch fixing issueWhen you enable TimedLogin by adding this to the [daemon] section of the /etc/gdm/custom.conf file:[daemon]TimedLoginEnable=trueTimedLogin=usernameTimedLoginDelay=30Then when the greeter starts up it is supposed to automatically select the ""Timed Login"" selection and start the timeout clock.  However this fails because handle_request_timed_login in gui/simple-greeter/gdm-greeter-login-window.c can be called before the users ""loaded"" signal is received.So, the GUI acts oddly in the situation when this failure happens.  The timed login user is highlighted but not actually selected so you can click on other users if you want.  The timer is active so you will autologin after the timeout.  However, if you click on any users in the user list or the ""Other"" user then you are not presented with an entry field to enter username/password information.  If you then click the ""Cancel"" button and try again, it corrects and then works.  But it is very confusing behavior.Simply fixing the code so that it checks the flag to see if users have been loaded and then to set up a signal handler so that it will select the timed login user when the event is received fixes the problem.After the fix in the attached patch the ""Timeout"" user is actually selected and you need to hit the ""Cancel"" button to end the timeout and select other users, or to re-select the ""Timed"" choice to restart the timer.  This is the intended way for the code to work.++Comment on attachment 157231  [details]  [review] patch fixing issuegreat++Fixed in master."
481343,orca,magnification,Initial top/left/bottom/right zoomer position settings don't match screen size,"I'm seeing an odd behavior from Orca's magnifier preferences GUI.  I have a Toshiba Tecra M2 laptop (single head) with a display of 1024x768.  When I bring up the preferences for the magnifier, the zoomer position defaults to the following values:Top:    1Left:   512Right:  1014Bottom: 758I think they should be:Top:    0Left:   512Right:  1024Bottom: 768In debugging a little bit, I don't think the problem has anything to do with what Orca is getting from GTK+.  Instead, I suspect it might be with how the GtkSpinButtons are configured.  I think some extra work might need to be done in orca_gui_prefs.py to set up their adjustment and such to match the display dimensions better.In looking at http://www.pygtk.org/pygtktutorial/sec-spinbuttons.html , I see the ability to set the spin button's 'adjustment' attribute.  I haven't experimented, but I wonder if something like this might work for each of the spin buttons:adjustment = GtkAdjustment(<<<settings.py value relevant to zoomer position>>>,                            0, <<<screen width or height>>>,                            1, 50,                            page_size)spin_button.set_adjustment(adjustment)Where <<<settings.py value relevant to zoomer position>>> is one of settings.{magZoomerLeft, magZoomerRight, magZoomerTop, magZoomerBottom}, and <<<screen width or height>>> is obtained from GTK+ and the appropriate one is used for the particular zoomer attribute (e.g., screen width for the left and right values, screen height for the top and bottom values).  I'm not sure at all what to do about page_size.++Created attachment 96334  [details]  [review] Patch to use Adjustment objects to set attributes of spin buttonsThis patch seems to fix the problem.  It uses the Adjustment class to set a wider variety of attributes for the spin buttons.  The ""/ 16"" part is just a somewhat random choice to set the page up/down increments.  The thought is that the user will probably be thinking in terms of ""1/2 the screen, 1/4 of the screen, 1/8 of the screen, 1/16 of the screen"".  So, this just works within the current constraints of the preferences GUI design and gives a granularity of 1/16 of the screen dimension.++*** Bug 481339 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 481340 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++Rich, Joanie, can you take this for a test drive, please?++That seems to solve the issue.

In an additional test, he deleted anything to do with magnification from his ~/.orca/user-settings.py file and the default values came up as expected.  So, I'll check this into trunk and work up a patch for gnome-2-20.(In reply to comment #6 ) > Without the patch I had:> > Top: 1> Left: 840> Right: 1670> Bottom: 1040> > With the patch I had:> > Top: 0> Left: 840> Right: 1670> Bottom: 1040> > Continuously hitting Page-Up for Top allowed me to get to 1050.> Continuously hitting Page-Up for Left allowed me to get to 1680.> ++The other thing that this buys us, which I didn't explicitly state in my initial comment, is that ""the issue"" is not just the initial settings.  It's that the Preferences dialog was happily and repeatedly stomping on the current values.  For instance, if I set my laptop to:Top: 0Left: 0Right: 1280Bottom: 800Those settings would stick -- until I returned to the Preferences dialog.  The mere act of pressing Insert+Space and then pressing the OK button immediately was sufficient to cause the Zoomer to be set to:Top: 1Left: 1Right: 1270Bottom: 790I didn't even have to go to the Magnifier page to trigger the change.  And if composite were not enabled, that's enough to grey out my entire display.  This patch helps a lot.

Orca has a ""Speak object under mouse"" feature that will speak the object that's under the mouse.  It does so when you move the mouse. This feature can be enabled/disabled via the preferences GUI, and there's also an unbound """"Toggle mouse review mode"" key binding for it.  This feature, however, is different from speaking text that has been selected.  If improvements or enhancements are desired to it, you should open a separate bug.++Created attachment 134700  [details] This is a test document.This is a test document.If I do select entire document with Ctrl+Shift+end key, the where am I works fine. If I select entire document with Ctrl+a key combination, only the first line was spokening, I don't known why.I agree your prewious comment. I quoted Daniel Rc letter because I don't known need this information with this feature. If the mouse key function known the function he want, I am very happy because I impossible test this because I not see the display.If need, I do a debug output with Ctrl+a situation.++In quickly debugging this, I'm running into some complex logic and behavior for how Orca determines what to speak for selected text.  It seems to depend upon the position of the caret relative to the selection and whether or not a selection begins on a line boundary.  This needs further investigation.++What your openion? Possible fix this bug with Orca 2.26.3 and Orca trunk release, or only Orca 2.28 release?++(In reply to comment #7 ) > What your openion? Possible fix this bug with Orca 2.26.3 and Orca trunk> release, or only Orca 2.28 release? As with all bugs, I will evaluate the impact on the code and the impact on the user.  For 2.26, we shoot for things within the release guidelines (no new strings, no API changes, no GUI changes, etc.) and for things that are considered to have high positive user impact and low risk of introducing new bugs.  As I evaluate the fix for this and other bugs, I will use this criteria to determine if I feel it is safe to push it into a 2.26 maintenance release or if it should be done solely for the new development cycle.  When this decision has been made, you will see a comment on this bug.++Here's the deal -- the where am I in a text area is supposed to behave as so:1) If there's no selection in the text, just speak the current line.2) If there is selection anywhere in the text, a basic where am I will only speak the text selected on the current line. A detailed where am I will speak all the selected textThe basic where am I implementation has a flaw, however, in that doesn't do proper boundary checking and will accidentally include text selected prior to the current line under some conditions.  So, what Attila was experiencing as desired behavior was the bug, and what Attila was experiencing as the bug was the intended implementation of the basic where am I.I propose we fix the basic where am I to behave as Attila expected and just do away with the detailed where am I.  That is, we make the existing detailed where am I become the basic where am I.  One reason is that the basic where am I as spec'd out now can lead to some confusion and it took me a while to understand why after I had fixed the basic where am I in my local workspace.  Here's an example:1) Start with your caret at the beginning of a line2) Press Shift+DownThe line is selected and the caret is now invisibly at the beginning of the next line, which is unselected.  So, doing a basic where am I as spec'd would speak nothing because the object itself has text, but no text is selected on the current line.  Do similar things with Home followed by Shift+Control+End and then Home followed by Ctrl+a.  It's not intuitive where the caret ends up.Mike, what are your thoughts?++I'm in favor of Wil's proposed change as it sounds like the current singlepress of the WhereAmI will fail quite often.++Created attachment 135263  [details]  [review] Patch to eliminate the ""selection on current line"" functionality(In reply to comment #10 ) > I'm in favor of Wil's proposed change as it sounds like the current singlepress> of the WhereAmI will fail quite often.

I can confirm this sometimes and not other times - it *seems* to strangely being related to me tabbing away and back to the OOo window.  Sometimes, the behavior Orca is providing is that the caret is now on the Attila line, so Orca is telling you the line of text that you are on.  Other times, Orca tells you what you just selected.  This will need more digging into.However, I think we're getting off the topic of this bug, which is about text selection announcement via the Where Am I command.  I've just retitled it to be more clear about the problem.Attila, please do the following:1) Test the given patch for text selection announcement via the ""Where Am I"" command.2) Open a separate bug for the announcement of text selection in OOo as you select paragraphs. > 2.

The typical use case for this is when the user selects text by pressing Shift+Down and the caret ends up at the beginning of a line.  An example is Ctrl+Home followed by a number of Shift+Down operations.  When this happens in something like OpenOffice, the caret can end up at the beginning of a paragraph -- that paragraph won't have any text selected in it, but the prior paragraphs can be selected. We need to detect this, which is what this patch does.++Attila - please give this test a try and let me know if it fixes the ""Where Am I"" woes you've been finding for us.

When using Orca's caret navigation to move amongst items on the left-hand side, Orca says/does nothing.2. Tabbing amongst links is hit or miss.3. Arrowing within the ARIA list of ""chat"" contacts results in no speech.4. Arrowing amongst items in the table which contains the list of messages results in no speech.5. If a content creator has marked an entry as ARIA, you cannot arrow out of it; but given the very same entry on the very same page, but no associated ARIA mark up, you can arrow out of it. (If we can't distinguish these entries visually, and we aren't providing ways to distinguish them non-visually, shouldn't we be treating them the same for a consistent user experience?)Note this bug is strictly to address the above issues -- otherwise this will become an uber bug. :-) Therefore, please test this patch for its ability to improve gmail access without breaking anything else. :-)(Pylinted and regression tested -- and actually solves 2 ""BUG?""s in the existing test and also one issue that isn't marked as a ""BUG?"" but probably should be).++This is much much much better!.

I see entries corresponding to other menu items in at-poke(when the context menu is unposted) when viewing nautilus.to restate:  I see a menubar in the nautilus at-poke hierarchy but notthe Open Terminal entry; likewise I see many entries which aren'tpresent in most instances of the context menu.  These menus aren't the""folder view"" menus - so what are they?++I now see that the context menu appears as its own top-level windowwhen posted by nautilus.  However there are two issues that presentthemselves:(1) what are the menus/what is the menubar in the Desktop that isactually a child of Desktop, but isn't presented to the user's view?(2) the context menu has items in it which do not appear in thepopped-down menu; for instance 'Protect', 'Format', 'Media Properties'etc. appear in GOK's menu (i.e. the ATK hierarchy) but are notactually posted to the screen, for the Wastebasket icon.Is there a property on those objects that I should be checking, i.e.SENSITIVE, etc. to eliminate these items from GOK's presentation? Currently GOK looks for state ENABLED, which these invalid items areexposing.++1) I am not sure what the menubar is which is reported as child of thedesktop but it does not have state SHOWING or VISIBLE set.2) The menu items which do not appear will not have state VISIBLE orSHOWING set. The states SENSITIVE and ENABLED are synonymous in gailfor objects corresponding to widgets corresponding toGTK_WIDGET_IS_SENSITIVE.++OK, well we seem to have a problem.  Since GOK (and our AT generally)doesn't require menus to be posted in order to access them, we cannotuse the 'visible' and 'showing' states to determine whether or not themenu items are valid in the current context.++I understand about menus but can you require that a menubar be visibleto use it?++In the current problematic case, the menubar is visible but some menuchildren are not visible.++The context menu is only created when the popup is requested.

That is because for both usability and pragmatic (i.e. gtk+conflict) reasons we must be able to activate menu items withoutposting the corresponding menus.I agree that this turns over some rocks that were not meant to beturned over, but I see no alternative (unless/until we implement somestate other than VISIBLE to indicate that menu items are ""hidden"" asopposed to just-not-posted-(yet)).That's why I suggest overloading INSENSITIVE in this case.++Ultimately - we should only be exposing items to the AT that are'VISIBLE'; > Sorry Michael - but we MUST traverse invisible items when they are > in menus.  That is because for both usability and pragmatic (i.e. > gtk+ conflict) reasons we must be able to activate menu items > without posting the corresponding menus. I think we are confused about the term 'visible' - theGTK_WIDGET_VISIBLE(w) boolean has nothing to do with whether you canactually see it on-screen, and everything to do with whether - shouldthe widget parent be mapped - the child widget should be so too. ie.it's the show/hide state.   Ultimately - we should not be exposing hidden widgets to the ATs -since it is a legitimate technique to have thousands of widgets hiddenin a given dialog showing some only when they make sense. It is ofcourse implicit that a hidden widget is insensitive since it cannot beactivated - it has no associated resources to interact with.   The solution is to ensure that the child indexes you hand out arenot g_list_indexes into container children lists - but insteadfiltered by visibility, with hidden widgets aggressively pruned.++The problem is that I do not think we currently can distinguishbetween 'VISIBLE' in the gtk_widget_set_visible sense, and 'VISIBLE'in the sense of 'mapped'.  Perhaps this needs to be a change in gailheuristics, but I am not sure about its implementability.  Padraig?++I think that this may be a problem in gail.If GTK_WIDGET_VISIBLE(w) is true we should set the stateATK_STATE_VISIBLE on the corresponding AtkObject. IfGTK_WIDGET_MAPPED(w) is true we should set the stateATK_STATE_SHOWING.The menu items in a submenu attached to a menu item in a menubar donot have the state VISIBLE set if their menu is not popped up.

363103,libgnomecanvas,core,roll Gail's ATK support for gnomecanvas (gailcanvas*) into libgnomecanvas,"This is required in order to move gail into gtk+ core, an RFE which the accessibility and gtk+ teams have slated for the next gtk+ release.Since gail currently depends on libgnomecanvas, we need to move gail's gnomecanvas code into libgnomecanvas itself before moving gail into gtk+.  This is appropriate and sensible since all other gnome libraries which contain custom widgets already have their ATK support provided internally, rather than relying on gail to provide it.++Created attachment 74943  [details]  [review] patch which adds the gnome-canvas a11y code formerly in gail to libgnomecanvas++Thanks for providing this patch. I'm going to take a detailed look at it on the plane tomorrow.++Hey Bill,  these files look like they have been just moved from gail (which isn't a problem as I would have started the same way). But I think you agree that the code in Gnome should always be in a shape as good as possible. Especially this code (which is likely to be copied by me into my cairo based canvas) should be reusable as easy as possible and to achieve this (along with some more consistency with the rest of the stack) I'd like to address some glitches with the current code:1. Please use G_DEFINE_TYPE() or G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_CODE() to define GObject types. This makes the current code easier, will give you »parent_class« features for free and is less likely to contain errors (such a macro might also be updated by the glib maintainers and GNOME canvas would get these updates for free then).2. Please use G_BEGIN_DECLS and G_END_DECLS in the header files (might require additional including of <glib/gmacros.h>) to be more consistent with the rest of the platform.3. Please don't use statements like this: > typedef struct _GailCanvas GailCanvas; ... > struct _GailCanvas> {>   GailWidget parent;> }; A simpler solution would be this: > typedef GailWidget GailCanvas; (which would also apply to ...Class as well)4. Can you please add documentation to the functions that are accessible (like gail_canvas_item_new()), this would make both the review and the quality of the code better.5. As this code doesn't seem to be public API, can you please add a file that explains both the purpose of the code (which is quite obvious) and how this code is supposed to be used by applications?(I'm not yet finished reading your patch, so maybe skip 5. - if already done - but at least be prepared for more to come - even though I doubt it)++There was just one more:6. Please don't export instance members in the header files (like in the following snippet): > struct _GailCanvasText> {>   GailCanvasItem parent;>   GailTextUtil *textutil;> }; Please use a private structure in the C-File. If textutil needs to be accessed from other pieces than gailcanvastext.c, please provide an API for working with this member.Thanks.++Hi Sven;A couple of comments:1) the use of internal struct members was common in gtk+ when these Gail classes were originally written.  Changing that now may do considerable violence to the gail code, though we could peck away at it class-by-class.2) gailwidget.h needs to be exported for this patch to work, and gailwidget's struct definitely requires internal members that are directly accessed.  Fixing that is too big a diff for gail to be practical.We have never been asked to document internal-only methods, in particular constructors like gail_canvas_item_new() which are NEVER called outside of the library.  I don't think it's really appropriate since the docs would just say ""do not call this method, it is an implementation detail required by GailCanvas"".I disagree about using typedef instead of ... > struct _GailCanvas> {>   GailWidget parent;> }; since the above is a pattern which is consistently repeated throughout Gail (sometimes with added structs, sometimes not).  Since we don't guarantee ABI stability of GailCanvas, new internal structs could be added at any time, which would invalidate the typedef.best regardsBill++to follow up point-by-point:#1 and #2 are OK by me (though personally I find the macros obfuscating); #3 is not; I don't see the value in #4; #5 and #6 are OK.++OK; revisiting;#1: existing gnome-canvas code doesn't use these macros.  I think that     it makes more sense for you to add them if/when you move this code to the new       cairo canvas.#2: sure, OK, though these macros didn't exist when gail was written either.#3: patch is consistent with existing gnome-canvas code      (see GnomeCanvasLineClass in gnome-canvas-line.h)#4: methods are used only by the factory instances.#5: there's no public API here, I guess we need to say that?#6: Not sure how to handle this one most elegantly. Making a new priv struct to hold this single member seems like overkill to me.++Created attachment 76554  [details]  [review] patch incorporating suggestions++> I disagree about using typedef instead of ...> > struct _GailCanvas> > {> >   GailWidget parent;> > };> since the above is a pattern which is consistently repeated throughout Gail> (sometimes with added structs, sometimes not).

Convinced.And for point 4, can you at least tell me how this code is supposed to work? As no application is supposed to use that code, how is it used? (I'm just not familiar with gail and I just like to get some information about it.)++Now commenting on the new patch. It would be great if you could use G_DEFINE_TYPE() (former point #1), then it looks okay (except for a missing dependency on gail in the .pc.in file).++Hi Sven:I'll add some docs to the exported methods (at least the key ones) to give at least a hint how the system works (with pointers to the atk docs if I can figure out how to include non-volatile references to other modules' api docs)As for G_DEFINE_TYPE, I notice that none of the other classes in libgnomecanvas use these macros, so the existing patch is consistent with the rest of libgnomecanvas.  Since libgnomecanvas is expected to be supplanted by a new canvas Real Soon Now, perhaps it doesn't make sense to add these macros now.  Besides, for technical reasons we cannot use G_DEFINE_TYPE or G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_CODE in gailcanvas.c (though we could potentially use it for the other classes).I believe the gail dependency is gone from the new patch; I will double-check.++> Since libgnomecanvas is expected to be supplanted by a new canvas Real Soon> Now, perhaps it doesn't make sense to add these macros now. That was exactly the reason why I requested using these macros. Once the new canvas is there, we could easily copy the files from gnome canvas into the new canvas (but, I'm fine if you don't agree on this one).Small wrap up:1. Do you think it makes sense to use G_DEFINE_TYPE() where possible?2. Can you please add a small piece of documentation on how this code is supposed   to be used? (eg. gailcanvasfactory)3. Please check for the dependecy on gail and either remove it or also add it to   the .pc.in file (as it doesn't appear in public headers it should go into the   private requirements field).4. Please also add the gail* files to the doc/reference/Makefile.am to prevent   gtk-doc from scanning these files.++Hi Sven: Thanks for feedback.

It seemed to be working fine until the last 'make clean'; 'make' cycle.  ?++Created attachment 80501  [details]  [review] fixed patch incorporating all suggestions plus ChangeLogI found the bug that was causing gtk-doc-scan issues.  Sven, does the attached patch look OK to you?I did not document anything that was explicitly excluded in the gtk-doc-scan headers, since this is private API.  A few symbols are exported for purely technical reasons, as they always were in the previous gail implementation.I think this patch should coexist reasonably with legacy gail, i.e. the factories for gnomecanvas as defined by gail should be replaced by the libgnomecanvas ones transparently.  If this doesn't work as expected, we can either change the namespace of the methods or remove the gnomecanvas code from gail and release the two new tarballs in sync (so libgnomecanvas HEAD would require gail HEAD).  If we don't have to do the latter, it's better IMO even though some loaders may complain about duplicate symbols.++Sven: ping?(BTW my above notes about duplicate symbols are theoretical, I haven't observed any problems on my system).++Herzi, ping?++Sorry, will look at the patch on the way to my parents.++Hi Sven, we are looking forward to move gail into gtk+ and libgnomecanvas as soon as possible. And the gtk+ is blocked by libgnomecanvas. Can you take a look at the patch when you get time?++Sorry, for waiting so long. I just forgot about this patch. It's committed to trunk now.++It looks like the dependency on gail was not so clever right now.

My co-author,Andrea Butter, was one of the original employees of Palm Computing. She sawthe tiny Pilot became a smash success, despite the fact that it had farfewer features than the hand-held flops that had come before it (such asthe Newton, Envoy, Zoomer and so on).</P><P>In the chapter about designing the original palmtop, Andrea suggestedthat I pay more attention to a Palm mantra in the early days, a favoritesaying of Ed Colligan, who was then Palm's vice-president of marketing:""Delight the customer.""</P><P>Now, Colligan was also responsible for many far cleverer mottos,including ""Avoid the bozo explosion"" (if you hire one clueless manager,you're dead; that person will hire more bozos, and they'll hire more) and""Underpromise, overdeliver"" (a reaction to Apple's marketing hyperbole forthe Newton palmtop). I e-mailed Andrea and said that to me, ""Delight thecustomer"" sounded not just obvious, but hackneyed. ""I mean, come on,"" Iwrote, ""NO company starts out with the intention to *disappoint* thecustomer."" </P><P>Her response by e-mail: ""In the technology industry, you'd be surprisedhow much 'Delight the customer' ISN'T the point. The alternative isn't'Disappoint the customer,' but 'What can we do with this neat technology?'The customer doesn't even come up in the product designers' thoughts...When you think of delighting the customer as the guiding light in makingchoices, it explains a lot why the Pilot ended up being a product peopleloved, and are so emotionally attached to.""</P><P>I have to admit that she has a point. From whiteboard to assembly line,a high-tech company makes hundreds of decisions. Cost, marketability andother factors often guide the decision making. Delighting the customer canbe expensive, time-consuming and difficult.</P><P>Ever since this exchange last week, I've found, all around me, theresidue of companies more concerned with their own intere_ts than theircustomers. You don't have to look far to find user-antagonistic technology.</P><P>If I seem especially crabby this week, it's because last night Iencountered the ultimate example. At 3:48 am, the smoke alarm in our housewent off, shrieking every few seconds with a volume loud enough to wake ourneighbors...in Canada. </P><P>I shook my wife awake. ""Honey, quick -- the smoke alarm. Get ready toget the kids!"" I ran down the hallway and followed the sound. But there wasno smoke -- and the smoke detectors were silent.</P><P>I finally tracked the alarm to my home office, where I found the laptopI'd been testing, wailing like a banshee. It turns out that its smoke-alarmimpersonation is supposed to be a low-battery warning. </P><P>I've seen stupid features in my time, but this one takes the cake.Eventually, I figured out how to shut it off, but whatever manager set iton by default must have thought the old Palm motto as ""Destroy thecustomer,"" or possibly ""Pray that the customer doesn't look you up and eggyour house.""</P><P>Sometimes, in other words, a product's failure to delight isn't a resultof corporate greed or corner-cutting, but simple mediocrity. You can'tdelight the customer if you can't distinguish the dumb from thedelightful.</P><p><i>Visit David Pogue on the Web at </i><A href="" http://www.davidpogue.com "">DavidPogue.com</a>.<p></font></TD>  </TR> </TABLE><BR CLEAR=""ALL""><!-- Inline Direct Ad begins --><br><IMG SRC="" http://www.nytimes.com/images/email/wine/advertisement2.gif "" WIDTH=""150"" HEIGHT=""15"" HSPACE=""0"" VSPACE=""0"" BORDER=""0"" ALIGN=""left""ALT=""Advertisement""><BR CLEAR=""ALL""><table width=""600""  bgcolor=""000000"" cellpadding=1 cellspacing=0border=0><tr><td align=""center"" valign=""middle""><TABLE WIDTH=""599""CELLPADDING=""3"" CELLSPACING=""0"" BGCOLOR=""#EEEEEE""><TR><TD><font size=""2""><AHREF="" http://www.nytimes.com/ads/email/ibm/ibmcircuitspos2.html ""><b>TransformYour Business Processes - Quickly and Painlessly</b></a><br>With IBM WebSphere software, you can change business processes withoutrebuilding your infrastructure.

You can compilethe GIMP on MacOS X just like you do on any other UNIX operating system.++You are right, MacOS X is based on a UNIX core.  On the other hand,some users may not know this (because they don't have to know) andlanding directly to the UNIX page can be confusing because nothingtells the user that the page applies to MacOS X as well.  Also, thereare some issues such as the X Server support for MacOS X (especiallyfor those who do not have the latest OS version) and it would be niceif they could be addressed somewhere.I am re-opening this bug report as an enhancement.  One way to fix itwould be to have a dedicated page for MacOS X, which would first tellthe users that they have reached the correct page (what you wroteabove may be a good hint) and then have a link to the UNIX page.  Inaddition, it could contain some Mac-specific links, such as someinformation about X support and some links to binary packages(e.g., fink).++OK, I agree that there's room for improvement. However, do we reallywant to start using Bugzilla for the new site before it replaces thecurrent one?

I was afraid that doing this would have been more kludgybut then again, since we can just compare the original source_urlstring with the new source_url string, it should Just Work (tm) Ithink? The reason most (all?) provider url compare functions don'ttake into account url params is because sometimes they can be hiddenfor when we don't want to pass around all the details of the account.ie, we wanted imap://fejj@localhost/INBOX to match the store object instantiated byimap://fejj@localhost/;namespace=""god-knows"";something=""else""all of this should just magically get fixed when we reimplement imapso that we can use the getv/setv methods that I started to implementearlier.++fixed in CVS"

It would be great if bugzilla.gnome.org could be updated to a later version.++I lack the time to do so. Help is appreciated.++How could I help?  What kind of help would you be looking for and from whom?++I guess you need a list of patches applied locally, and update them to work with 3.0.1. bkor probably has such a list somewhere.++The bigger things are: * patch-status (drop down lists on show_bug.cgi to easily change the status of a patch... the entire status stuff is custom.. upstream only has flags) * Boogle, see Bugzilla/QueryParse.yp in bugzilla-newer * using postgres (need to fix all custom reports) * porting all reports * switching the UI (easiest) * showing who is a dev (hard, need one SQL to determine this; in 3.0 I'm use groups to determine who is the dev of a product.. it is very hard to get the comments + 'are-you-are-dev' in one SQL.. see bugzilla.gnome.org module Bugzilla/Bug.pm, GetComments)Note: if you check out bugzilla-newer (2.20), do a cvs diff on it to see the changes vs upstreambugzilla.gnome.org module contains the 3.0 version, obviously it isn't finished++FTI on postgres (Pg) docs: http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/gist/tsearch/V2/ (I knew about the site, but it was way too technical before.. now it is better.. still not great) http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/fts/doc/  http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/fts/fts.pdf  http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/talks/fts-pgcon2007.pdf ++Alpha version of FTI for Postgresql: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=365258 Rolf: Please drop by #bugs on irc.gnome.org and ping me (nickname bkor). Most likely available in the evenings; CET/CEST timezone.++So, after consulting LpSolit & some consideration (mostly regarding time it takes to code a proper solution & staying close to upstream), I think it is better just to check for specific groups for the developer/maintainer stuff for the next bgo.It will be a bit like the:[% FOREACH group = comment.author.direct_group_membership %]in Bugzilla CVS HEAD.. although I have to check what direct_group_membership doesThis means the only big problems are (in order of difficulty): * patch-status (need to make it much less hackish than it is now) * Boogle (I hope not too much changed in the table structure) * porting custom reports (Pg support, make use of objects, etc) * changing UI (the library.gnome.org layout)++Oh, forgot about points... Currently they are pretty hacky and so I'll ignore how it is done ATM. In the upgrade, I want to track the number of open/closed/add_comments on a userid basis. And whenever the user opens/closes/add a comment, I'll update the user right away.Note: This is slightly complicated in the closing case. This as we only want to grant max 1 user a closure per bug. I'm thinking of storing a who_closed_it (something better) column in the bugs table.If that is set, the user is substracted 1 closure. After that the bugs.who_closed_it is updated with the new user + new user gets additional 1 bugs_closed.Not sure how easy that is to do. Might have to wait for the Bug.pm update code in 3.1 (dev for 3.2).This is the solution I want to push upstream btw. If LpSolit doesn't complain here ;)Or perhaps use triggers.

99523,pango,general,Add support for additional writing directions (vertical),"Pango needs support for additional writing directions.  Inthe initial version of Pango, support is only present forright-to-left and left-to-right text. However, verticalwriting is also important in many applications.One reason why vertical text has not been implemented inPango-1.0 is that the target rendering system, X, has weekfacilities for handling text in other than a horizontallocation. The obvious, though not the only, way of treatingvertical writing is to keep the logic inPangoLayout the same, but to have animplicit transformation of the coordinate system.

The change for each module is only a few lines. The new relationship is recognized by Orca. Performance differences (note that the number which follows ""new way""/""old way"" are the number of child nodes. The number after that is the time in seconds. The performance improvement is bloody huge.

I've left the debugging statments in because there seem to be some occasions where the new relationship I created is not in place. I'll look into that more further.This also doesn't eliminate all slowness in the gconf-editor tree, but it seems to make one hell of an improvement.I'm not blocking this bug quite yet because I want to see what else is slowing us down as well as see why sometimes the relationship is not in place.All of this said, Will, whatcha think? It is presumably an API change, but it's a minor one I think. And a desperately needed one I think. Please let me know. Thanks!!++Created attachment 127383  [details]  [review] possible solution (has debugging print statements)Added another timestamp debugging line just in case the first way fails. Sorry for the spam.++Nice!  I say try to push this, though the Orca code should also include some defensive try/except checks in the event it runs into old AT-SPI code that doesn't have NODE_PARENT_OF.  Nice work!++I am suffering this problem navigating in Thunderbird when I have a so big list of messages (about 2000 messages in my inbox).

I am using Orca trunk, and latest Thunderbird.++Created attachment 147293  [details]  [review] proposed patchNow that at-spi, atk, and gtk+/gail from git master all have NODE_PARENT_OF, this patch causes Orca to check for this new relation and use it if found. It falls back on the old logic otherwise. And, as Will suggested, it's now in a try/except.I tried this with gconf-editor and it reduces the time it takes to Orca to present expanded nodes from 20+ seconds down to 3+ seconds on my machine. 3+ seconds is still not acceptable, but it sure beats 20+ seconds.... Anyhoo, I'll take a look to see where the 3 seconds is coming from.Will, please review. Thanks!(BTW, I didn't bother adding it to the Pidgin script yet because Pidgin doesn't use this relationship and I didn't see any point in checking for a relation which we know won't be present.)++Created attachment 147336  [details] dtrace output from one onActiveDescendantChangedFWIW, this is what occurs from start to finish once onActiveDescendantChanged has been called in gconf-editor.

Well, I just turned that off, and all debugging in Orca off, and while Orca's gotten more performant as a result, I'm still seeing the 3-second lag. I'll dig some more before closing this bug out. After sleep and brain cell regeneration. :-)++I'm *pretty sure* that the remaining lag is the result of: Bug 577098 - GtkTreeView (lists, Nautilus) is very slow with Assistive Technologies enabled (at-spi)We have a different blocking/tracking bug open for it, namely: Bug 547880 - Long delay when starting nautilus Therefore, I'm closing this bug out as FIXED because the outrageous delay we were seeing was solved by the addition and use of the NODE_PARENT_OF relationship.

395749,orca,general,Orca has a hard time keeping focus in tables,"Please describe the problem:When arrowing through table- and/or list views, Orca reads the first few items in the list and then suddenly says: ""Table view"" or something like that and after that, it goes silent. Pressing the up arrow once then going down with the down arrow reads the list items again up to a certain point and then the same problem comes again. This happens in list- and table views across all of Gnome, such as in Nautilus, Gedits ""open"" and probably ""save"" and ""save as"" dialogs, in OpenOffice.org etc. I have seen it on rare occations in the file browser as well.Steps to reproduce:1. Go to a table or list view by for example chosing Gedit and a dialog dealing with files such as ""open"" or ""save as"".2. Arrow down in the list of files and notice the behaviour. After 2 or 3 items Orca says the name of the control, for example ""table view"" then stops speaking.3. Arrow up once, notice that the focus is brought back to the list items.Actual results:After a couple items, Orca says the name of the control, ig ""list view"" and then goes silent. Up arrowing brings things back to normal for a couple of items, then the problem repeatts itself.Expected results:Orca should announce each item in the list as they are arrowed to.Does this happen every time?Not in all cases, but in file open or save dialogs, yes.Other information:++Created attachment 80139  [details] Orca debug generated whilst trying to reproduce this problem.I'm not able to reproduce this on my machine.This is with Ubuntu Edgy and Orca from SVN trunk today.It's on an Acer Ferrari 3500 AMD laptop and using the Festivaland Cepstral Swift speech engines. I've attached a debug.out of Orca debug generated whilst tryingto reproduce this (with Festival TTS) when arrowing up and down in the Open dialog in gedit.Perhaps others can try it and see if they get different results...++Okay, I think I see what's happening. I noticed from another emailyou you said you'd upgraded to Feisty. I just went and tried thisagain on my Feisty machine and what I'm seeing is a load of:Traceback (most recent call last):++immediately after the event is emitted, probably to eliminate a memory  leak.  This exposed a problem in Orca.  In Orca, we add events to a queue and process them later.  With this new  change, any remote reference held in the any_data field is no longer  valid after our callback is called.  Thus...when we do something like  the following in default.py, we're looking at an invalid object:  wwalker@ubuntu:~/orca/trunk/src/orca$ find . -name \*.py | xargs grep -n    any_data | grep makeAccessible  ./default.py:2290:        child =   atspi.Accessible.makeAccessible(event.any_data.value())  And, we get this error:  vvvvv PROCESS OBJECT EVENT object:active-descendant-changed vvvvv  OBJECT EVENT: object:active-descendant-changed         detail=(10,0)    app.name='acroread'           name=None role='tree table'  state='ENABLED FOCUSABLE FOCUSED SENSITIVE SHOWING VISIBLE  MANAGES_DESCENDANTS' relations=''  Traceback (most recent call last):    File ""/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/orca/atspi.py"", line 680, in   __init__  self.accessible.ref()  OBJECT_NOT_EXIST  Now...for how to fix this.  I think we need to find out where the  any_data.value() reference is done and then make sure we do that when we  get the event.  So...  1) In atspi.py:Event, get rid of getAnyData.  It's no longer used     and I'd rather not maintain it.   :-)   2) In atspi.py:Event.__init__, which is called immediately when we     get an event from at-spi, do some magic to determine what the     event type is and create/reference the accessible there.  We     probably should just do something like the following after we     get the any_data (i.e., just before the 'else' on line 111):     if e.type == ""object:active-descendant-changed"":         e.any_data = Accessible.makeAccessible(e.any_data.value())  3) In default.py:onActiveDescendantChanged around line 2290, use     e.any_data directly:     child = event.any_data  This might work.  In addition, the ""object:text-changed:insert"" and  ""object:text-changed:delete"" events also seem to have an any_data whose  value() we use.  These may be other areas for changes similar to the  above.  That is, just make e.any_data = e.any_data.value() and then  change the associated uses in gnome-terminal.py and default.py to use  event.any_data instead of event.any_data.value().""++Created attachment 80262  [details]  [review] Patch to reference any_data values immediatelyThis patch hopefully fixes the problems.  I tested it with GNOME 2.16 to make sure it didn't introduce any new problems there, but I need some help testing it on a GNOME 2.17 system.

With gnome-vfs you could do:if ((info->valid_fields & GNOME_VFS_FILE_INFO_FIELDS_BLOCK_COUNT) != 0)	alloc_size = dir_info->block_count * BLOCK_SIZE;I guess we could add some attributes to gfileinfo to get this where it makes sense. Maybe a standard::block-count attribute and a filesystem::block-size attribute? Or is it better simply a standard::allocated-size attrribute?++Makes sense to me; I'd probably go with the allocated-size attribute, but thats up to Alex.++Looking again, G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_UNIX_BLOCK_SIZE and G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_UNIX_BLOCKS are exactly what you want, no ?++I guess they are.

Maybe we want to> have a real allocated size without having to know magic unix specific things,> like that blocks are always 512 bytes.> Just that blocks seldomly are 512 bytes those days: ext2 allows 1024, 2048 and 4096, but not 512. XFS is 512..4096. FAT and NTFS  block size varies from 512 to 32768/65536 bytes.Disk-usage programs, like du (or gvfs-du) are expected to report disk usage rounded up to multiples of the file systems block size. So some kind of G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_BLOCKS (size in fs blocks), or G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_BLOCK_SIZE (block size of the underlying file system) would be quite useful, I guess.But agreed: G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_UNIX_BLOCKS itself really looks crufty.++Its true that the actual blocks used by filesystems are not 512 bytes anymore, however, this has no affect on the ages-old stat() API. Check the manpage for instance:       The st_blocks field indicates the number of blocks allocated to the  file,  512-byte  units.   (This  may  be  smaller  than       st_size/512 when the file has holes.)       The  st_blksize  field  gives the ""preferred"" blocksize for efficient file system I/O.  (Writing to a file in smaller chunks       may cause an inefficient read-modify-rewrite.)the st_blksize field is totally unrelated to st_blocks, which is always in 512 byte units.I don't see any reason to propagate this block using thing in the gio API, it breaks down anyway in presence of things like tail-merging. We might as well report the actual use in bytes.++(In reply to comment #11 ) > I don't see any reason to propagate this block using thing in the gio API, it> breaks down anyway in presence of things like tail-merging.

(2 TiB for a sector size of 512 bytes).  It reports the    partition size as minus size and creates a 1 TiB file system.GParted wants a single maximum file system size and the code is notready for a differing maximum file system size for different sectorsizes.In fat::create() could specify larger ""logical"" sector sizes to mkfs.fatwhen the partition is larger than 2 TiB to allow maximum volume size tobe increased further.  However that will take a lot of cross platformtesting to ensure that all sorts of devices support ""logical"" sectorsizes other than 512 bytes on devices with a hardware sector size of512 bytes.  This is too much effort.Therefore implement a single FAT32 maximum volume size of 2 TiB.++Created attachment 324336  [details]  [review] Limit FAT32 maximum volume size to 2 TiB (v1)Hi Curtis,Here's the patch for this.Limiting FAT32 to 2 TiB seems like the simple thing to do.Thanks,MikeOther notes:I had a test of the other file systems and there are several which limitthe maximum volume size to 16 TiB (2^32 * 4 KiB block size).  They are:ext2, ext3, ext4 (older tools without 64bit support), reiserfs.  Notdoing anything about these.Other file systems are happy to create volumes larger than this.(Reiser4 not tested).Also found that on CentOS 7 and recent Fedora distros that partition/dev entries are automatically created for partitioned loop devices.++Thank you Mike for implementing a FAT32 maximum size limit.For testing I used the following steps:1)  Create a big device (3 TiB) using a sparse file.        IMGFILE=bigdev.img        truncate -s 3145728M $IMGFILE        sudo losetup /dev/loop0 $IMGFILE2)  Run GParted 0.25.0 and test GPT/FAT32 partition create (1/2/3 TiB).        sudo gparted $IMGFILE    RESULT: GUI permits all three of 1/2/3 TiB FAT32 create operations.3)  Run GParted with patch and test GPT/FAT32 partition create (1/2/3 TiB).        sudo src/gpartedbin $IMGFILE    RESULT: GUI permits both 1/2 TiB FAT32 create operations.            GUI prevents 3 TiB FAT 32 create operation.            Largest FAT32 size permitted is 2,097,152 MiB.4)  Remove big device.        sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0        rm $IMGFILEBased on the results this patch works as expected.The patch in comment #1 has been committed to the git repository.The relevant git commit can be viewed at the following link:Limit FAT32 maximum volume size to 2 TiB https://git.gnome.org/browse/gparted/commit/?id=2bb78cf8dc0028fc5d01044655a7cf12bb01d95d Note that after I pushed the commit I noticed that we forgot to appendthe bug number to the git title.

It is only done for a few of the multimedia keys++Excerpt of the conversation with Jody, who has a very fair point:<jody> the capplet communicates with the settings daemon via strings in gconf<jody> the settings daemon is what makes the changes<jody> when a user hits the 'play' key the first time<jody> the capplet calls eggaccel* to look up the logical name of the key<jody> it fails to find a keysym and returns 0xae or something<jody> we set that in gconf<jody> the settings daemon gets notified and loads the string '0xae'<jody> assigns a keysym of 'XfreePlay' to that<jody> user clicks on the entry again or reruns the capplet<jody> The capplet needs a display string for the key<hadess> and play will be assigned to play?<jody> yup, it now has a nameI believe that gdk_keymap_translate_keyboard_state() shouldn't send back keysymsthat aren't GDK keysyms in the eggaccel* functions.++I'm advocating a simpler approach to solving this that will avoid attempting tostore the old keybindings (and keeping that store in sync with the server). Lets just add a test at the ui level to disable assigning a key with existingkeysyms to the special modmap managed keys.  This is by no means perfect1) setting directly from gconf will still screw things (not a big problem)2) We'll want to be careful not to display an error message when assigning thesame key again now that it has a keysym.Failing that we can either ignore the problem (which has worked to date) orditch the functionality until post 2.8.++*** Bug 148969 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++Mdk bug for this : http://qa.mandrakesoft.com/show_bug.cgi?id=12022++Additional info from duplicate Bug 148969 :If I bind ""WinKey+Z"", then even plain ""Z"" triggers the shortcut.

[Used copy and paste to get these.]++Luis, I don't think you tested that properly.The problem was that most of the media keys (Play, Pause, etc.) were not filtered by the ""acme"" part of g-s-d, but simply mapped an xkeysym to the keycode using xmodmap.g-s-d doesn't call xmodmap to bind single keysyms anymore, and expects the keyboard (xkb and co.) to already set those up.With the current code, you should be able to get your key back by pressing ""Backspace"" after having clicked to change the keybinding.The only thing left to be done is to remove the ""Media"" keys (those that use to be bound to keysyms instead of caught and acted upon) from the keybindings capplet.++I didn't read it properly.

It causes broken-desktop situations for users (keys stop to work with no obvious way to fix)++So here's how I understand things...Rhythmbox (and presumably other apps) watch for specific keysyms: XF86_AudioPlay, XF86_AudioStop, etc. and react to those.  Our XKB keyboard data doesn't have very good coverage for mapping those keysyms to physical keyboard keys so when a user presses the Play key on their keyboard it doesn't generate XF86_AudioPlay.  Bastien's code worked around this, such that if a user explicitly set up a keybinding in the capplet for Play then the settings daemon would run xmodmap to create the mapping between the key the user pressed and the keysym XF86_AudioPlay.  This was a workaround because we don't have good XKB coverage.  It also was a bit buggy.  For the near term, I think we should just rip that code out and change rhythmbox (et al.) to call XGrabKey on the keycode derived from the keysym saved in gconf for that action by the capplet.  I've heard that muine already does this.Long term, apps calling XGrabKey at all is a bad idea.  The settings daemon should handle that and we need to work out some sort of protocol for notifying the foreground app the key was pressed.  In this case ""foreground"" means app currently with the focus or some app specified in Preferred Applications if the currently focused app doesn't participate in the protocol.++Also, we need to fix xkeyboard-config to have better coverage of the multimedia keys on keyboards.  Then the user just has to make sure they choose the right model in the keyboard capplet and things should work (even for legacy apps that just call grabkey on the play keysym directly)++The latter still sucks though, as applications will be fighting over the grab.I agree with the other bits, as I discussed this with Ray.++Created attachment 71553  [details]  [review] what i built into rawhideso this is what i built into rawhide. It's pretty similiar to attachment 57153  [details]  [review] , but it leaves the entries for the multimedia key in the keybinding capplet, expecting apps to handle actually watching the keys.

So we would basically only allow single key presses of keys that aren't normal typing keys.The above patch is a stab at this, but I don't have a multimedia keyboard here to test it, so it might not work.  Also, I think one improvement to the patch might be to only allow binding to keycodes with either no keysyms or the XF86* keysyms instead of reusing the mega conditional thats already in accel_edited_callback for a different purpose.++Created attachment 76654  [details]  [review] Don't allow key combindations that probably aren't multimedia keys and save keycode instead of keysym in gconfSo I played with the patch in attach 76621 a bit this morning when I got to work.  It seems to work okay, for the most part, but one problem I ran into was if I bound Play to the play key twice in a row, the second time it would show up as XF86AudioPlay instead of the keycode.  This is wrong because it means that the next I log in, its going to try bind to XF86AudioPlay which won't exist.The above patch fixes this by always storing the keycode in gconf for multimedia keys.Again, this patch is more of a near-term stop gap solution than a real fix.++Created attachment 79159  [details]  [review] Use D-Bus interface for the multimedia player keys++Created attachment 79345  [details]  [review] Updated D-Bus interface for the media player keys.++Created attachment 79347  [details] A sample plugin for banshee which uses the D-Bus interface defined above.++Patch looks good to me, except for one thing, which is that, instead of starting a new DBUS server, I guess it would be better to reuse the DBUS server that is created in gnome-settings-dbus.c.

Alt+Tab shows the popup with icons and window titles andalso shows a floating window highlight in space. Based on those 2 pieces ofinformation in 2 different locations on the screen, one has to guess whetherthis is the window you want or not.In comes Alt+Esc, which shows you what the screen will look like when you let goof the Alt key.

There are two problems - for one, because we call a lot ofgtktreeview/gtktreemodel api and emit signals while manipulating our cache offlyweight references, it's very easy for objects in our list to die while we'remessing with them or traversing the list.  Even if we keep track of a flag inthe cell_info indicating that a cell has died, we may continue to operate on acell (AtkObject instance) in the destroy handler, which can result in callingatk_object API on an object which has been unreffed already; this is unsafe andin fact even the basic GType macros can fail when called on destroyed GObjectreferences.Obviously architectural changes are required.++BTW I don't think there's a need to mirror this in Sun's internal bug trackeruntil/unless outward symptoms manifest.

Some background: + when you remove an applet from the panel, the gconf directory containing the prefs of the applet is removed + wnck-applet continues running if you remove the workspace switcher since it also contains some other applets + when an applet is removed, we tell the gconf library we're not interested in the gconf directory of this applet anymore, but it keeps in cache the previous values + when we reuse the same applet number in the panel, and old gconf directory is used for the pref. It doesn't contain anything (yet), but in this case, values are still in the cacheSolution: when we tell the gconf client we're not interested in a directory anymore, remove values from the cache. It works for me.++Nice catch vuntz - my main suggestion would be to use gconf_key_is_below() in clear_dir_cache_foreach() ... i.e. /foofoo isn't under /fooAnother problem is that we are be removing too much from the cache - i.e. if we do  gconf_client_add_dir (client, ""/foo/bar"");  entry = get (client, ""/foo/bar/1"");  gconf_client_add_dir (client, ""/foo"");  gconf_client_remove_dir (client, ""/foo"");then the entry for ""/foo/bar/1"" isn't cache before, even though it clearly should be. The only problem that would cause, though, is that the value would have to be re-fetched.That's a minor issue compared to the fact that we seem to be removing the notify for ""/foo/bar"" when we remove ""/foo"" - see foreach_setup_overlap() So ... the patch looks good to me - make it use gconf_key_is_below() and commit++s/isn't cache before/isn't cached anymore/++Thanks, committed in HEAD.

I'm just coming on board to this and don't have the ability to recategorize bugs yet.Wikipedia tells me that the population of Benares (Varanasi) is 3.1M and Tiruchchirappalli is 1.1M.  As for the other city names: I don't believe that libgweather currently has the ability to support multiple names for an individual city; I'll see if and how this can be accomplished.  I'm hesitant to just go in and change the names since we're trying to get away from the maintenance monster know as Locations.xml.in and there's some bugs suggesting alternatives.++Alright, but I it should be noted somewhere that the names have been changed. These names are pretty outdated.Also, Wikipedia has a list of the most populous Indian cities : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_populous_cities_in_India Tiruchchirappalli isn't on that list and Varanasi is down in 28 (while Bangalore is No. 3 and Pune No. 8).

I didn'tcheck the source but I assume some adaptation of Newton's method isused. There are two reasons the user may need to supply an initialguess. The algorithm may not converge with the default initial guess.There may be multiple solutions. It is more than just a lark that theother spreadsheet allows this optional argument. (What would be reallynice would be for the user to specify an upper limit and then for thefunction to return all ""physical"" solutions less than thelimit...probably too hard to eliminate mathematical pathologies.)2. NPV documentation and definition: The documentation should indicatethe first cash flow isdiscounted. Incidentally, the first cash flow, traditionally negativeought NOTbe discounted--the value of future cash flows is ""netted out"" againstthe initial investment, hence NET present value.3. PV documentation and implementation:  This is a basic financialfunction so the documentation shouldbe completed asap. The ""type"" argument should be optional and shoulddefault to ""0""--like the function ""rate"", for example.4. PMT documentation: Although the function appears to work correctly,thedocumentation is in error.

I sat here updating the situ in the""additional comments"" window and then lost the whole thing (I think).Since v1 is out I thought it might be helpful to review the basicfinancial functions.  As I say, it's 99% mopping up.There are seven functions I'm calling basic:PV: doc needs exampleFV: in doc, prototype ""term"" should be changed to ""nper"" for consistencywith other functions; prototype should also indicate the last twoarguments are optional and what their default values are.  also needsexample.PMT: doc needs exampleRATE: no documentation at all--probably because, like IRR, there aresituations where there are actually 2 rates (eg. rate(2,260,-100,-445))and it is only in cases like this where the rate function might need to behelped with a different initial guess than the default.NPER: I haven't checked Excel, but I'm surprised the last two arguments(fv and type) are not optional.  NPV: would be nice if Formula Guru labeled the first entry as the rate.IRR: like ""rate"" (but more importantly) there may be as many solutions asthere are sign changes in the cash flows; suggest warning along withexample like -100, 260, -165, (this is equivalent to the one for rateabove), and note that the other rates may be found using sufficientlyclose initial guesses, the default being .1.Off the wall:  it would be nice if PV were extended to allow an extraargument, g, such that        pv = C(r-g)*(1-(1+g)^n/(1+r)^n).This gives the value of a constant growth annuity; in particular when thegrowth g is 0, you get the usual annuity formula back.++I have fixed the doc part of FV, except example.I've made NPER's last two args optional.Re. the rate functions: I would guess that the number of possiblesolutions can be as high as the number of points.  Less if you cutout any <=100%.  In practice, however, it seems that gnumeric (and XL)find the one you meant to find.Leaving this open for later.++Why does NPER raise a #DIV/0 error for a negative rate? OASIS is calling this a bug: http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/32469/OpenDocument-formula-20090508.odt p. 183.++That's a bizarre way of reporting bugs.Fixed: we now allow rates from -100% to 0% too.  Rates below that makesno sense (and would require a different formula if we just want to solvesome equation and call that the result).++It seems that the documentaion of NPV is still incomplete. The RATE function should be checked. I think those are the only 2 items left.++There is no RATE function...++Unless I am mistaken, there is nothing left here. If I missed something please open a new bug for it, preferably one bug for each function that has an issue.This problem has been fixed in the development version. The fix will be available in the next major software release. Thank you for your bug report."

It doesn't always fail but, if I pick a largish file with no preview, it almost always crashes if I double click without waiting for the preview to complete/display.I wonder if this is a race condition between threads.

Ensure ""Highlight WikiWords"" is enabled1. Type a WikiWord that begins with ""Mac"" into a note, such as ""MacNotes""Actual results:The WikiWord is not highlighted.Expected results:The WikiWord should be highlighted.Does this happen every time?Yes.Other information:Occurs on 0.4.1 as shipped with Debian Unstable as of filing.MacIver in ##gnome on Freenode confirmed that the bug is present in 0.5.0.The problem is also reproducable by taking an extant WikiWord, such as, well, ""WikiWord"" then prepending ""Mac"" to it. As soon as the string is finished, the highlighting disappears.++Hah!  This bug has almost certainly been around since 1.0, when I originally implemented the WikiName highlighting.  The reason this happens is that the WikiName code avoids common spanish/scottish/dutch prefixes (called patronymic name prefixes), including:   Mc, Mac, Le, La, De, VanThis was originally done because it's annoying and confusing to have certain people's names (like MacDonald) highlighted.  Perhaps this list should be revisited or removed altogether.  I think Mac, Le, and La could be generic enough to cause problems. Especially Le and La for Spanish speakers.++Ah-ha! I was baffled as to how the string ""Mac"" could break the highlighting! ""It's a feature"" :)The exclusion list makes sense, but reveals another bug: It's possible to create two notes with identical names, yet differing bodies.Steps to reproduce:1. Create a note ""MacTest"" with text ""menu"" using the ""Create New Note"" function.2. Link the word ""MacTest"" in a note using the manual link button. Give it body text ""link"".(At this point you'll note that linking ""MacTest"" does *not* take you to the note with body ""menu"")You now have two notes with identical names, but differing content.3. Open the Table of Contents. Note that the (one and only) ""MacTest"" entry takes you to the ""menu""-bodied note.4. Click on the MacTest link. Note that it takes you to the ""link""-bodied note.Amusing corner case, no?++Oh, and:5. Removing the ""menu""-bodied note leaves the table of contents devoid of any mention of the ""link""-bodied note. This creates the potential for orphaned and undiscoverable notes.++Setting the default assignee and QA Contact to "" tomboy-maint@gnome.bugs "".++I tested Tomboy 0.15.0 and CONFIRMED this bug.My two cents: WikiWords will always highlight things you don't want highlighted.  Not highlighting MacStuff will confuse users.++I agree, we should get rid of the exclusion list, or make it configurable if people really want it.+++1 on no exclusions (no defaults at least).

724603,gnome-sudoku,general,Automatically hide notes when a box is filled,"Created attachment 269494  [details]  [review] Patch to hide notes when a number_box is filledWhen I play this game, I use the top notes to manually keep track of the available numbers. However, when I input a number in the square I don't need them any more, and I actually find them pretty distracting.I'd love it, then, if the notes would automatically hide when a square is filled. I'm attaching a patch that implements this. It's not a great patch because there should be an option to enable/disable this behaviour, you can still interact with the notes when they are hidden, and I'm not that familiar with the code to know if this is the best way to implement it.On the other side, I tested it and the content of the notes are preserved, and they are shown/hidden when a number is added/deleted manually, when you undo/redo or hide/show/delete a tracker.Any comments on how to improve the implementation are very welcome.Cheers,  Arnoques++Review of attachment 269494  [details]  [review] :Sorry this patch went unreviewed for so long.I agree that automatically clearing notes like this should be the default behavior, and I'm not sure that it should be configurable anyway.  But at this point I'm only interested in patches for the vala-port branch, which will be merged into master probably within the next month or so.++I’ve seen a web implementation of a sudoku game that has an elegant solution: just let you input five numbers in the tile and have a lower font size when you have two or more. As notes are usually used to mark all-the-possible-numbers-of-this-tile, if you write only one, it’s that you think it’s the good number; if you enter more, it’s that you’re taking notes.Adapted to our game, it means only one popover by tile (I’ll talk about having only one popover elsewhere…), and when you check more than one togglebutton, use earmarks; else, use normal font size. And that would solve the touch problem[1].[1] https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=733436++It would be nice to have only one popover, but the big disadvantage to that approach is that the normal case (no earmarks) becomes harder: the popover isn't immediately dismissed when selecting a number. So I hesitate to change that.The touch problem can be solved by using a long press to open the earmark popover.++(In reply to comment #3 ) > It would be nice to have only one popover, but the big disadvantage to that> approach is that the normal case (no earmarks) becomes harder: the popover> isn't immediately dismissed when selecting a number.

Anything that might be special to your scenario, which can make it hard to reproduce?++I don't know what could be useful... I have Data Execution Prevention installed on my system, but even after turning it off, GIMP still crashes...The bug repeats each and every time i try to open a file, try to save a new file or try to use Save as and i go with the included file browser to a folder that contains graphical files...I will try reinstalling the program, maybe i get lucky.++Nops, reinstalling had no effect... Btw: The old version of GIMP that i had installed worked properly. I believe that was 2.2.++Sounds like a problem creating the preview thumbnail but that doesn't explain why it happens for you.++Here are some very interesting facts:I've noticed that the crash won't happen if in the folder are only .ico files so i've decided to test with these kind of files: gif, png, jpg and bmp.The result was crashing only when a bmp file was in the folder i was trying to open.Next i've noticed that it even crashes if no graphical files are in the folder, but there are subfolders. Repeted several times and it confirmed: if the folder i am trying to view contains another folder (or a subfolder, whatever you like to call it), GIMP crashes instantly with the same error.So it seems that there are 2 different branches here: crashes if bmp file in folder and crashes if the folder contains subfolders.Hope that was helpful, i am a programmer but i did very few desktop applications, i mostly do sites. If you need some other info, just ask.Great job with GIMP!++If it also happens with sub-folders, then it is more likely a problem in GTK+. We need a stack-trace from the crash to find out what exactly goes wrong here.Someone please explain Octavian how to obtain a copy of GIMP and GTK+ with debugging symbols and how to create a useful stack trace on Windows.++Created attachment 101187  [details] the file that causes the crash++I've tried to find documentation for getting that dump information, but i haven't found how to do it for windows and i don't have too much tim to search.Anyway, here is a little update. It's pretty bad news as far as i can see, but here it is: I've done a graphic, saved them in a folder with no subfolders nor bmp files (graphic format was gif), then created a new graphic, tried to save in that folder again (the folder is my pictures, so would be the standard folder opened by the file peeker) and GIMP crashed!In shorter words: GIMP crashes when i tries to read the files it creates.One more interesting fact is that when trying to copy in Gimp and paste into Photoshop (i've just installed a trial version to get my work done), Photoshop states: ""Could not import the clipboard because an unexpected end-of-file was encountered.""Dunno if the incidents are related, but a close look would be nice.Here is the graphic file that causes GIMP to crash, maybe you find something in it.++Maybe these crashes are caused by some other tools.  Are you running a virtual desktop manager or a program that allows you to associate actions or macros to some mouse or keyboard combinations?  Do you have any tool that allows you to enhance the interface or the behavior of other programs?  If yes, could you try to disable or uninstall these tools and see if GIMP is still crashing?The attached image does not contain anything strange and other users do not seem to be able to reproduce the problems that you describe, so we still need more information from you before we can investigate this bug report further (for example, a stack trace or a confirmation that the crash may be related to some third-party tools).++This is incredible strange...Yes, i have some programs like that installed...1) DesktopX: I've unistalled it, but no change.2) HyperIM (used to change some status in yahoo messenger): closed it for testing3) MSI LiveUpdate: closed it for testingThe result: GIMP now didn't crashed when i opened my pictures, neither when i opened my documents (the parent folder of my pictures). When i've tried to open Tavi (the parent folder of my documents), it crashed again.Reopened HyperIM and MSI LiveUpdate. The same result, didn't crashed when opening my documents, crashed when openint Tavi.Uninstalled HyperIM and closed MSI. Same result as before.Copied the file that i attached earlier in the folder My pictures: GIMP crashed as soon as i've opened the file picker (as My pictures is the default folder it opens).Deleted the file that caused the crash and now comes the strangest part: GIMP didn't crashed when opening the file picker, but crashed when opening my documents (it's parent).I dunno how to interpret that. I could use a stack trace, i just need a link on how to the the tool.++This bug happens to me too, and I have explored it a bit. I tried the new GIMP on 4 PC's. I've found, that this bug comes only if an older version of GIMP was installed before the new. It seems, the new GIMP (or GTK) uses some old files or settings.++That seems to indicate a problem with the Installer.++Can anyone reproduce this with the current 2.4.3?++I've tried, but after installing 2.4.3 the file picker works without crashing The GIMP! Thx! :)"
411301,tomboy,General,automatic bullets can be annoying,"I'm using 0.5.8 and finding the automatic bulleting feature (when the line starts with -) to be really annoying. I wasn't able to find any way to disable this feature. I really like the bulleted lists for other things, but I'd prefer to manually start the list from the menu or a hotkey.My use cases are:1) I keep track of my monthly job status in Tomboy, which I later paste into a plain-text email to send for collation into a team status report. Everyone else uses - to prefix their status items, so I have to manually change the dots to -'s before I mail my status.2) If you create ASCII tables using the - character, the table gets converted to a bulleted list.Thanks for your consideration and for Tomboy.++Sounds like a good candidate for a GConf preference.++Steve, so automatic bulleting feature is not actually the problem here but the conversion to plain-text is? The dot looks better than - but I don't even know how to get a that kind of dot out of my keyboard. Is it commonly used somewhere? Should it be changed to - ?++The automatic bulleting is a problem for use case 2) because it prevents one from making the table. I guess adding table support to Tomboy would be a work-around, but I don't know if anyone has plans for that.As for the copy/paste issue, Firefox converts list bullets to the * character, which is a reasonable approximation. But the HTML page containing the list specifically requested the bullet whereas I requested a -, so it's not quite the same issue.I agree the dots look better, and I use them for other notes that I don't paste into emails, but I'd rather activate them myself. But that's just my preference.++Created attachment 97196  [details]  [review] Patch to add a preferences option to disable auto bulleted listsThis adds a checkbox in the formatting preferences to enable/disable the auto bulleted lists feature. Some of the spacing came out weird in the patch but it lined up in my editor, not really sure what happened.++Created attachment 97198  [details]  [review] [UPDATE] Patch to add a preferences option to disable auto bulleted listsThe patch before this had a bug where you couldn't delete bulleted lists when auto bulleted lists were disabled.++The above patch works perfectly with the current SVN.  I'd strongly urge the maintainers to merge it while it's hot.++Anyone have a problem with exposing this in our UI?Either way, need to update the GConf schema to include this key.  Oh, and we use 8-space tabs, not 4-space (I know we're inconsistent in our tab stuff so no worries).The patch looks great otherwise.  :-)++Created attachment 100492  [details]  [review] Allows you to enable/disable auto bulleted listsThis also updates the schema++Let's do it!++fixed in r1653++Since upgrading to 0.10 I haven't been able to make auto-bulleted lists with neither * nor -, even though they are enabled in my preferences?++Just after submitting my previous comment, I found this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tomboy/+bug/203316 - apparantly, bulleting without a following space (such as entering simply ""*[enter]"" instead of ""* [enter]"") has been disabled with this patch."

In that case we need to get the original size of the image from _gnome_thumbnail_load_scaled_jpeg and gnome_gdk_pixbuf_new_from_uri_at_scale.As such, i think mike morrison is on the right path. I'm not sure I would export the gnome_gdk_pixbuf_new_from_uri_at_scale_full function publically though.Also, it doesn't correctly handle the _gnome_thumbnail_load_scaled_jpeg case.

Which is bad but not catastrophic.The crash comes as soon as we get a client request, apparently linc fails to handle an error code from accept(), ends up with a NULLGIOChannel and segfaults:5298  socket(PF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0)   = -1 EMFILE (Too many open files)5298  gettimeofday({1016580730, 697012}, NULL) = 05298  gettimeofday({1016580730, 697158}, NULL) = 05298  poll([{fd=5, events=POLLIN|POLLPRI, revents=POLLIN}], 1, 299259) = 15298  gettimeofday({1016580734, 601825}, NULL) = 05298  accept(5, 0xbffff1a0, [2])        = -1 EMFILE (Too many open files)5298  --- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---The saved state file grows exponentially as gconfd crashes over andover, and stuff goes to hell big time.Ugh.This is going to be hard to fix. For a long time I've wanted to makean architectural change where clients save their per-client state, andthe daemon is basically stateless (on daemon crash, clients resendtheir state to the daemon). Which gets rid of saved_state.But that's a lot of work to rearrange so I've been putting it off...Even then it doesn't solve the fundamental problem that we can't everhandle more than 1000 or so clients.

So I need to distinguish a parseerror from an I/O error in xmlParseFile(), but I have no idea how I'ddo that, the API doesn't seem to allow it - in fact error reporting in libxmlworries me quite a bit. I'll ask Daniel.++I'll take a look at the linc issues - as for the XML issues - perhapsthere is no better time to switch to a push parser (as in librsvg) andpreferably the SAX interface (as in librsvg) ;-)++Fixed the linc sillies - thanks for the report.++I don't quite see how you could get 3500+ linc files, that's realbadness, but I've just fixed a couple of places where these might leak- but not at anything like the order needed to create that many I think.++Looking at linc CVS, I thinklinc_server_handle_io will still get a warning, since IIRC we didn't change the G_OBJECT() cast to allow NULL, I could be wrong. Moving the bug to linc so you can check that to yoursatisfaction, it's fine to close the bug afterward.++Just fixed the warning and did a new release for you.++*** Bug 75504 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"

For example, the document will be printed as landscape, but the paper will be feed in portrait mode.  This results in the document falling off the right side of the paper.This process should be reduced to one step to avoid confusion.++*** Bug 334719 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++This really looks like a libgnomeprint bug.++I'm also confused by the two Feed Orientation options (in Gnumeric, at least).

The printout would be perfect if I could feed the paper through sideways, assuming that the printer could print that widely.  As it is, the top three inches of the paper is completely blank and the right three inches of print fell into oblivion.I chose the option to print to PDF and surprisingly, it shows the error, sort of.  The only difference is that in the PDF, the printout is centered vertically whereas on paper, the print is just a margin (0.75 inches) off the bottom.  (I'll attach the PDF file.)The print preview is always perfect, but the printout is not.No matter what I try, I cannot get *any* gnome app to print landscape.  I have to save gnumeric in gnumeric format to keep my changes, then temporarily save in w95 Xcel format (because OO cannot read gnumeric format), and load that into Open Office spreadsheet and print from there.Every gnome app I've tried to use to print landscape has this problem.++This seems to be resolved in newer versions of GNOME."

119560,gimp-web,www.gimp.org,Screenshots should be re-done,"We should have a new set of screenshots showing gimp-1.2 and 1.3 (or 2.0).They should follow these guidelines:- not too large (Branko suggested a size of 800x600)- no other application on the screen- no copyrighted images edited in the GIMP windows- no disturbing background imageIf possible, the screenshots should be taken in the default environment ofthe OS used: default background, default theme, etc.  The goal is to showthe interesting things that can be done with the GIMP, not the other fancyfeatures of the environment.Anybody could easily contribute some screenshots.  Maybe a request couldbe posted to the gimp-user list?  We would then collect them somewhere anddisplay the best ones on the web site.++This bug report is about the web site currently under development,i.e. the one that can be found at http://mmmaybe.gimp.org .++I have three screenshots that could be used at http://www.xs4all.nl/~collin/gimp/pr/ The accompagnying HTML file contains blurbs for the screenshots,explaining what they are showing.++Let me add a bit about these suggested constraints: - A lot of users (more than 10%, some sources even say around 50%[*])still use 800x600 screens. GIMP users are often power users and use1024 x 768 or even 1600 x 1200. A typical web browser on an 800 x 600screen has about 750 x 550 pixels space for a web page[*]. Users hateto scroll, especially horizontally[*]. This means that a lot of thescreen shots you see on the web nowadays will not be viewed entirely.Often, in my experience, these screenshots use their available spacebadly.This does not mean that larger screen shots are useless or will neverbe viewed. You just should think about the space you require, and tryand use only that.- ""no other application on the screen"" / ""no disturbing backgroundimage"": again, this is a recommendation. The idea is that thescreenshot should be about the GIMP, the story it tells should beabout the GIMP. Use your own judgement, though.++[*] = mail me if you want sources for these statements++It seems a number of people don't want 1.3 screenshots to go onmmmaybe, but prefer them on www. In that case, would it be possible toadd a link to the screenshots page to link directly to the screeniesof 1.3? A text along the lines of ""Screenshots of our development version are available on <ahref="" http://developer.gimp.org/screenshots.html "">the developerswebsite</a>""Preferably up top, from my point of view. But if people decide to putit down at the bottom, that's OK too.Dave.++Excuse the thinko - above, when I said ""...don't want 1.3 screenshots to go on mmmaybe, but prefer them on www"", I meant ""...but prefer them on developer.gnome.org"".Dave.++Changing all www.gimp.org bugs from gimp product to the gimp-web product,including old closed/fixed bugs, and reassigning.++A screenshot section has been added to www.gimp.org now.

So if this patch addresses most of the problem, and hence makes Orca better, would it make sense to check it in now? Then we can make sure we underline image links as part of the 'get the contexts when we get the line' bug.Thoughts?++fine with me.++Cool thanks!

I'll investigate more tomorrow or Friday.++Created attachment 118135  [details]  [review] patch with updated testsThis patch updates the regression tests. A couple of the updates were things that just needed updating independent of this patch (like the new Print dialog), but the rest were the result of this patch.1. We're not displaying the role 'link' any more. That was the bulk.2. Marked some to-do ""BUG?""s:- Before we removed the role link, we used white space to separate the role from the rest of the text. So given the sentence: ""Is Willie Walker, our fearless leader, going to the GNOME Summit in Boston?"" where ""Willie Walker"" and ""Boston"" are each links, we used to braille ""Is Willie Walker Link , our fearless leader, going to the GNOME Summit in Boston Link ?"" While a little odd, it would probably be odder still to slap the punctuation right up against the ""Link"" role. However, now that we're underlining links instead, the ""shouldn't slap the punctuation on the role"" is no longer an issue and we should be able to punctuate -- and presumably should be punctuating -- things like any other sentence. But we're not doing that with this patch.  So the example is now written out as ""Is Willie Walker , our fearless leader, going to the GNOME Summit in Boston ?"" Not ideal, IMHO, but I'm not convinced it's a show-stopper either. Anyhoo.... It would take too long to mark all of the instances where this occurs in the tests, but I did mark a couple to be sure it stays on our radar. We can always do them as part of the updateBraille() refactor.- This patch doesn't address the underlining of images which are also links; just textual links. We should (I assume) be underlining them. I wasn't sure if we should leave the role 'Link' in place until we implement that, or take out the role and worry about implementing the underlining later. Currently we have the role still in place. Again, I didn't mark each instance; only a couple.- We have one instance where there is a link followed by a combo box and the test includes tabbing to the combo box. Before what is visible is the combo box that just gained focus (cursor == 1); now the line is visible (and cursor == 21):  - BRAILLE LINE:  'Severity Link : Severity normal Combo'  ?                          -----  + BRAILLE LINE:  'Severity : Severity normal Combo'  -      VISIBLE:  'normal Combo', cursor=1  +      VISIBLE:  'Severity : Severity normal Combo', cursor=21  ?                 ++++++++++++++++++++                      +I *believe* I've solved all of the stalling issues. Yea! If not, I'll catch them next go 'round.I've got one outright ""we should fix this now"" issue.

HOWEVER, of more concern is what happened when I tried to reproduce the issue via actual use. Try this: Navigate to Bugzilla and Tab amongst the links at the top of the page. (New bug, browse, search, etc.) I don't have my actual display hooked up at the moment, but according to the braille monitor, the underlining is off/displaced a bit to the right -- and it becomes further and further displaced to the right as you tab from left to right on that line. :-( My gut is suggesting that this might all be the same issue (i.e. are we treating those 'middle dots' and/or any non-breaking space chars that might be present as two characters when in reality we should be treating them as one??)Like I said, I'll investigate this last issue next.  Will, what do you think? Solve the last issue, check in the patch, and leave the other issues as to-do's?++Created attachment 118140  [details] test caseStill debugging but here's what I know so far....1. Compare tabbing amongst the first and second sets of links in the attached test case. In the first set, the underlining gets progressively more and more off. :-( In the second set, things work as expected. :-) The difference? The presence of multi-byte characters *surrounding* the links in the first case. The issue isn't the new link-related code; the link-related code just brought it to our attention. I could be wrong, but I suspect we'll see something similar once we add support for attributes in Gecko.2. in the __init__ of the Region class in braille.py, we have the following line:        self.rawLine = string.encode(""UTF-8"")Get rid of that and set self.rawLine to string (unicode), and suddenly the bug I mentioned magically vanishes.Now to figure out exactly what this rawLine is for. We're undoubtedly doing what we're doing for a reason.... :-) Eitan if you're reading this and feel like chiming in with a hint, I'm all ears. ;-)++Okay, I have no idea if this is the right thing to do or not, so feel free to point and laugh (as long as when you're finished, you give me the answer. ;-) ).  HOWEVER:If, in the Text class' getAttributeMask(), we base the stringLength on the what we'll be displaying, i.e.:  -  stringLength = len(self.rawLine) - len(self.label)  +  stringLength = len(self.rawLine.decode(""UTF-8"")) - len(self.label)we suddenly seem to do the right thing -- in my extremely brief and limited testing.My gut tells me that this seems safe because we're just changing a single figure in the method for creating the mask, and logical in light of the bug in question. I'll run the regression tests and see if it makes a difference. And then we'll go from there I suppose. :-)++Oops, that blows something up in OOo. :-(++Correction, we blow up just fine without that change.

There might incorrect assumptions going on in braille.py that we are dealing with strings that do not contain multibyte characters.  In general, we should be doing all string length and character analysis using unicode characters, and then converting to UTF-8 for passing to 'external' things.  So, your change looks fine.I'm scared about other places where we might be doing the wrong thing in braille.py.  But, I guess we can try to table those fears for now and work on getting this stuff to work and not crash when dealing with single-byte characters.++(In reply to comment #19 ) > should be able to punctuate -- and presumably should be punctuating -- things> like any other sentence.

Yea!Thanks so much!!!The one change I noticed in some of the FF regression tests is the introduction of a space here and some extra (but proper) characters there. We undoubtedly were dealing with (hacking around) the underlying bug in the Gecko script. So.... I'd like to spend some time today seeing if I can address the space-after-link issue and figure out what our work-around/hack was and if it can be removed. After that, however, I say we check this puppy in and move on. :-)Thoughts?++Unicode patch committed.  Thanks for testing, Joanie! > So....

Pushing out.++Created attachment 119629  [details]  [review] work in progress, here for safe keeping (i.e. don't look) :-)1. updateBraille() currently takes out valid (i.e. navigable) whitespace (sometimes more than one character's worth) and replaces it with a braille region containing a single space character. This makes a mess of things on several fronts, the most notable w.r.t. this bug being the ability to underline links in braille while preserving the original/desired spacing and punctuation of the document. Still working on this, and it's very much in the ""just get it working"" phase.2. Links are underlined -- and should not be surrounded by extra whitespace now.3. Image links are now underlined and I believe the whitespace with them is also correct.4. Both are done via the braille generators rather than directly in updateBraille(). Other stuff is as well.5. Beaucoups of updated regression tests (including little notes to myself, and BUG?'s I still need to work out).I'm attaching this now rather than later out of a paranoid fear that if I don't, I'll somehow accidentally delete it. That said, I think we're pretty close to having this one in the bag.++Created attachment 119656  [details]  [review] just about there I think.... (alright, you can look) :-)This version fixes some of the things I needed to work out. There are still a small number of BUG?'s, but they seem to be few and far between.I also tested this some this morning with my Alva Braille Terminal 340 (yes, I'm THAT old). Cursor routing seems to work, as does clicking on/activating links and image links via cursor-routing keys. Yea! I have not yet (re)installed liblouis to see how contracted braille is (or isn't working), but given the nature of the change I would think this patch didn't break anything....Going to mark this as testing required, because I suspect/hope it might be ""good enough for government work"" in its current form. There are other open braille-related bugs (displaying headers in table cells, indicating attributes, indicating selection, etc.) in which I can continue my updateBraille() changes/cleanup. :-)I'm also going to repurpose this bug. The bulk of the (code-related) changes in this patch are about all of the whitespace issues plus the need to rely upon the braille generators in updateBraille() more than we do. And, oh, by the way, links are underlined. ;-)++This seems to be working well.  One question: Should we also be underlining other clickable items such as buttons?  Take for example: the search button on www.google.com.  My guess is that we probably should.++(In reply to comment #32 ) > This seems to be working well. Yea! Thanks Mike!! > One question: Should we also be underlining other clickable items such as> buttons?  Take for example: the search button on www.google.com.  My guess is> that we probably should. Maybe. I dunno....1. Do we underline other clickable things outside of web content?  Or is it assumed that the user will see the role and know that buttons are clickable? Whatever we do, I think we should be consistent.2. That sounds like we might want a ""clickable"" class in braille.py(??) or add clickable as a property of component and/or region(??)3. Would we remove the role in that case?4. What exactly is clickable? I can click on a radio button to select it. I can click on a list to give it focus.  I suppose those aren't actions, though. so does ""clickable"" really mean ""actionable""? And if so, combo boxes have associated at-spi actions for expanding and collapsing them -- also accomplished through clicking. Do we underline combo boxes as well -- or only do so when they aren't focused? And if focus is a menu item within the combo box, the menu item does not (I believe) have an action. Would we underline it because the combo box (parent of the parent of the menu item) does?Put another way, I totally defer to your judgment on what we should do around these issues. But these issues sound like they far exceed the scope of the (non-trivial) issues addressed by this bug (whitespace, links, and image links). Therefore, I think what might be worth doing is giving this some more thought and if the decision is indeed to underline clickable objects, open a new bug and spec out the exact behavior and where all it applies.Thoughts?++After more testing I think this patch is worth checking in.  I'll file another bug on the new functionality.++Thanks Mike. Done.Before doing a final commit, I always do a number of functional tests just to be darned sure. In doing so I noticed that with this one particular test case using OOo 3.0 beta m7 we were not underlining the links. But then I tested without the patch and we still were not underlining links in that document. Not surprising I guess: This patch is almost exclusively changes in and/or used only by the Gecko toolkit. Still I wanted to be sure. Anyhoo, I'll investigate this OOo issue separately and file a new bug if need be.Wiping brow and moving to pending.++Closing as FIXED. And there was much rejoicing. Yea! :-)"

When it emails, the subject line always has""System Check"" and then the date and time it was run. I wanted to set up a filter that would put all the system checks intothier own subfolder, named system check. I did not create the folderbeforehand.  I went to tools, selected filters, clicked add.  I named it""System Check"".  In the ""if"" section of the filter definement screent, Itold it match if the subject line contained ""system check"".  In the""Then"" section,  I selected ""move to folder, then clicked on ""<clickhere to select a folder>"".  At first I wanted it to be a folder off themain branch named ""System Check"", so I clicked ""new"" named the folder,the selected ""Local FOlders"" and clicked OK.  Now back in the ""SelectFolder"" window, I changed my mind and decided I wanted it to be  asubfolder of the Inbox instead, so I clicked and dragged it to theInbox.  At this point Evolution complained bitterly at me. It said""Error while 'Moving messages tofile:///home/endikos/evolution/local/Inbox/subfolders/system check': Nosuch folder /home/endikos/evolution/local/Inbox/subfolders/systemcheck"".  Then it shoed that I Had two folders names system check... oneoff the main branch, and one in the inbox even though it got mad at mefor doing that. I tried this a couple more times, moving it to adifferent folder, say contacts or outbox with the same results: errormessage, then it appears there anyway.  This confused me a bit, but Ijust clicked ok, then clicked ok again at the filter definition screen,clicked ok at the filters screen.Now looking at my folders, I have several copies of system check, inmiscellaneous places. I clicked on the one in the main branch and itcame up.  I clicked on any of the others, And they complained at meabout not being there.  Then I right clicked over one and tried todelete it, and it complained that it wasnt there.   Close evolution andreopened it, now all the ghost folders were gone, leaving me with theone in the main branch, which I still couldnt drag and drop withoutcreating more ghosts. So I deleted the one in the main branch, andstarted over, this time creating it in the Inbox, which worked.  Butthen I checked my mail, and the filter didnt work until I actually wentto Actions, then Aplly filters, and then it moved the system checkmessages to the appropriate folder for me.Unknown reporter: williamkn@zianet.com , changed to bugbuddy-import@ximian.com .++This is similar but not identical to other filter issues, I think, soconfirming. William: is it still a problem?++This is most not anything to do with filters, but with d&d of foldersin the shell.  Some of that is probably fixed by now.Its sort of a duplicate of a couple of bugs, so i'll just close it.BTW, are you using imap or what for the source folders?"

603321,NetworkManager,IP and DNS config,[review] Publish DNS changes via D-Bus - bg/dns-dbus-bgo60332,"The DNSChanger (aka ZLob) Malware changes the DNSSettings of the local router (at least if a default password is set) and changes the DNS to a malicious one. This is used for Phising and can be used to disable updates of security software.Some DNSChanger even start a DHCP server on an infected computer (windows, Mac) and spoof DHCP replays to switch the DNS.Network Manager could ""learn"" the normal DNS for the networks and notify the user if the DNS suddenly changes. Maybe restrict it to ""changes to a totally different network"".Network Manager could also keep other programs informed (DBus) about the current state. This could be important for package managers and other security software. The could switch to ""IP instead of URL mode"" to still get the updates.I expect other malware to use similar tricks - this feature could improve the security of the local network.++NetworkManager should definitely publish DNS list via D-Bus (with the possibility to follow changes).This would allow you to build a simple program to monitor it and/or integrate this funcionality elsewhere.This could also be potentially useful for NetworkManager's integration withlocal recursive DNS servers, if they choose to follow NetworkManager's DNSstate.@dcbw: Where does nm-tool get this information? I can't see it here: http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/developers/api/09/spec.html++The DNS info is available via IP(4|6)Config objects http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/developers/api/09/spec.html#org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.IP4Config  http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/developers/api/09/spec.html#org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.IP6Config org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Device properties points to them when the device is connected.Both nm-tool and nmcli get IP configuration via D-Bus (using libnm-glib).Example:nm-toolnmcli -f IP4 dev list iface eth0++Thanks. So it's split between IP4Config and IP6Config. Maybe we could add something like DNSConfig to report exactly what would go into resolv.conf?++Based on some discussions a few weeks ago, I started working on this, although I'm abandoning it half-finished for now; I'm going to try to get back to it later. You can see the current state in the danw/dnspub branch. (The server side of it seems to basically work; you can look at the o.fd.NM.DnsManager properties in d-feet or via dbus-send/gdbus, and they're correct. The client side is unfinished, and I wasn't 100% sure about the best / most-libnm-glib-like way to expose the split-dns data.)The idea is that using this, it should be possible to make NMDnsDnsmasq be an external program, reading the DnsManager properties to generate its config. And likewise, by allowing NMDnsManager to call arbitrary dns-setting-up scripts, which could access these properties, people could implement behavior like in bug 695384 and bug 673793 and bug 656260 .The SplitDns property here does not exactly match the current dns=dnsmasq behavior; instead of dividing the world into VPNs and everyone else, it divides the world into devices with never-default=TRUE configurations, and everyone else. Because if your VPN isn't set never-default=TRUE, then it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to avoid talking to its DNS servers, right? (OK, no, actually, that's not right either; there are three kinds of names: VPN-internal names that only your VPN nameservers can resolve, site-local names that only your non-VPN nameservers can resolve, and global names that anyone can resolve. So, the interfaces still need a little work. I guess switching it back to the way that dns=dnsmasq currently works might be the right thing.)(In reply to comment #2 ) > The DNS info is available via IP(4|6)Config objects FTR, note that VPNs currently have no D-Bus-accessible IP config objects, so in current NM, it's impossible to get the full DNS config via D-Bus.++NM bugzilla reorganization.

See bug 65501 .         */ Bug 65501 has been resolved fixed, so someone should fix this.++I have a patch for this, but I question whether fixing up this dialogis the best thing.  I propose that we disable the Add Bookmark actionwhen we are viewing a page that already has a bookmark.  Comments?++Created attachment 22848  [details]  [review] Proposed patch that also HIG-ifies the dialog++-		gtk_widget_show (GTK_WIDGET (dialog));+		gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));We want to decrease the number of modal dialogues, not increase it.++Fair enough, but my reading of the HIG says it should be modal.  It isclearly an error alert from the HIG description of alerts.  And theHIG says that all alerts are ""object modal.""I can provide a non-modal version if you disagree with my interpretation.++ccing Dave. Michael could you please cite the piece of the HIG inquestion ?++For some general alert information: http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/1.0/windows.html#alert-windows . This in part says, ""An alert has a border similar to that of adialog, and is object modal,"" but the whole section is relevant.For error alert information: http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/1.0/windows.html#alerts-error . This says, ""Display an error alert when a user-requested operationcannot be sucessfully completed.""  This sentence, and the paragraph itis from, indicates to me that we are dealing with an error alert (andmy patch treats it as such).++However, in http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/1.0/windows.html#window-props-modality , the HIG defines only app-modal and system-modal:A modal window, while it is open, prevents the user from interactingwith other windows in the same application (application modal), or inall applications, including the desktop itself (system modal).I interpret ""object-modal"" to mean modal only for the window fromwhich it was shown.++Yeah I think the dialog should be window modal. So gtk_dialog_run isok but we need to add the dialog to the parent window group so thatit's modal only to his parent window.++Bah, I just found out that gtk_message_dialog_new_with_markup doesn'tmake the dialogue hig compliant. Sucks.Maybe we should use libeel's eel-alert-dialog instead?++I think using eel api is a bad idea. If we want an api that can do higdialogs we should discuss one with gtk people or have a differentimplementation of current gtk api (depending on what are the plans forthe future).++I know that you want to have forward-looking done with a view towardsincluding it in gtk+ :) -- I though eel was just such a staging area,like egg?Okay, since the resulting gtkmessagedialog isn't HIGgy, I think thisbug is WONTFIX and we should just remove the FIXME comment from the code.++> I though eel was just such a staging area, like egg? No libegg was created exactly to avoid the mess created by librarieslike eel and gal. Probably the idea of sharing the code with otherproject and move the improvements in the real libs at some point waspart of the reason to create it, but since there was no rules to makesure the code was liked by target modules maintainers, it never reallyhappened.This doesnt automatically mean eel code isnt a good candidate to bediscussed for addition in egg (never actually seen it).++Why do you say that the alert from my patch isn't HIG?  I know thatGtkMessageDialog doesn't do it by itself, but in the patch, I correctits errors (separator bar, window title).  So, I thought I made thedialog HIG.  Except of course for the modality issue, which I willsubmit a new patch for.  I think it would be a shame not to improvethis dialog just because GtkMessageDialog isn't perfect.++Yes, but the spacings are all wrong too. Of course that may becorrigible from code too.Basically this is just a rant that gtk+ doesn't follow the hig atleast with new api like this new convenience constructor.++It would be interesting to try to hack an eggmessagedialog thing. Thecode is small and very simple, it looks like a 20 minutes work. Thenwe could try to propose it for egg or at least use it internally (asephymessagedialog). Note that the api would have to remain exactly thesame, just changing namespace.++I would like to work on that.  I'll shoot for an EphyMessageDialog fornow and we can see how far we get with it.  I'll submit the patch tothis bug.++However, are you sure that the API would remain the same?  I thinkthere would be non-trivial improvements to be had if we had an APIlike this:GtkWidget *ephy_alert_dialog_new (GtkWindow *parent,                                  GtkMessageType type,                                  GtkButtonsType buttons,                                  const gchar *primary_text,                                  const gchar *secondary_text);This would be a bit better than GtkMessageDialog's API because itdoesn't use GtkDialogFlags (which we would want to set the same forall alerts) and it provides a convenient shortcut to primary andsecondary texts.  This is useful because programmers using markup andtranslateable texts have to do a little monkeying to make sure themarkup doesn't appear in the translations.  Comments?++I dont want to bind epiphany to apis that are not blessed bymaintainers of the target library (gtk+ in this case). Doing so bringto disasters like eel and gal where you have tons of helpers that youare unable to get rid off and that stop people to reuse your code inother projects (because of the dependencies on helpers). In this casethere are already several projects that implemented their own,different apis (galeon, eog, nautilus that I know).To avoid a big amount of work when gtk will finally have hig friendlyprompts we must ensure to work on an api that can be moved in gtk atsome point, libegg is the way to go for it.As long as we keep the same api it wouldnt be too bad to have a localsolution (libegg would be still better though). But if we need to addapi then I think we really need to discuss it with gtk+ maintainersand get it in libegg.Since I think porting and adding your api wouldnt be a big work, Ithink it would make sense to do it and post a mail on gtk-devel. Ifnothing this will have the result of starting a discussion with one ofthe major gtk problems ...++regarding modaldon't use gtk_dialog_run if you can avoid it at all costs. It causes aruned dialog to block interaction with the whole app which sucks dueto the use of a recursive mainloop.Ideally dialogs like these should probably be window modal to theirparent window (according to auspex). When I last talked to seth aboutthese he recommended just not using modal dialogs at all cuz doingthem right at the time proved to be very hard (had to use windowgroupsin gtk etc.)Regarding using gtkmessagedialog...personally i don't like the api, itdoesn't provide easy ways to implement correctly spaced dialogs andfor now i'd rather just manually build them (as we are). and yes itwould be nice to have nice simple apis for implementing HIG dialogs(i'd like to see gtkalertdialog for instance)++Comment on attachment 22848  [details]  [review] Proposed patch that also HIG-ifies the dialogMarking attached patches in open bugs.++Mass reassigning of Epiphany bugs to epiphany-maint@b.g.o++Fixed in cvs."

Please, ask to an english speaking guy on IRC and commit.Thanks,Paolo++According to various people on #gnome removing the ""Do you want to"" isfine, since ""Do you ..."" leads to ""Yes"" or ""No"" response buttons,while omitting it leads to ""Revert"" response.Anyway since #usability was silent at the moment, so I'm cc'ingusability for a final response.++You can omit the item if your users don't need it.If you keep it, let the user have some measure of how much will changeby indicating when to file was last saved, how much time has passed,or something like ""%d lines will be lost and %d lines will be changed.""An alternative button could allow the user to see a diff instead.Removing the limits from Undo/Redo, so that the user can either redoall the changes or undo the reversion, would allow you to eliminatethis alert entirely.++(copying some of the comments I made on IRC)I'm not sure about other peoples, but I never used/noticed the Revertitem myself: the few times I needed to restart from scratch with afile I just closed the file and reopened it from the list of recentlyopened docs.If it stays:- maybe the secondary message could become ""Changes made to the filewill be lost"" instead of ""You will not be able to undo this operation""(of course adding ""... changes made in the last x minutes... would beeven better)- providing a diff button: not sure... it's a nice idea but probablyit's overkill, beside the ""diff"" plugin is in a separate package(gedit-plugins)- undo: beside being (probably) hard to implement (you are reloadingthe file from disk, not making changes to the current loaded doc), Idon't think it's really necessary; IMHO the user is really saying:""Hey I really mean to throw this crap away and restart from scratch!"".Beside even if the action could be undoed, I'm not sure if the alertdialog telling the user that he is reverting all the changes he madecould be removed.++I think it should stay.About the other comments, I agree with Paolo B.- I think the secondary message should become ""Changes made to thedocument in the last X minutes will be definitively lost""- about the ""Diff"" button: I think it is overkill.

Wouldn't it be more useful to actually log the output of the child to a file? (together with the contents of the text buffer at the time the user decides to start logging, maybe?) Otherwise, it is quite hard to save long outputs, like the one produced by jhbuild, say. I have no idea what the UI for such a thing might look like.++If I know before that i need to log the output i would use the 'script' or 'tee' command. But most often something happened way back in the buffer which I need and this patch saves me from selecting a few thousand lines with the mouse and pasting them into a text file. Since there is no way to search the buffers content in g-t this comes in handy as a workaround, too.Other times I need to store an important sessions output, like a filesystem check for example.Adding realtime logging would be a different issue, since you know before that you want to log. How about adding a checkbox menuitem 'Log to file' which opens a filedialog to receive the logfile name and afterwards writes input/output to the file until unchecked?++(In reply to comment #14 ) > Adding realtime logging would be a different issue, since you know before that> you want to log.

Thanks, I hadn't thought about the accessibility api. These signals are used internally for communication with the accessibility peer.So basically g-t has to register itself as a peer and use the atk api to write to a file?++I looked into atk and wrote a little test terminal. The desired events only get emitted if accessibility is enabled at log in. Maybe there is a way to enable them from gnome-terminal itself, but honestly this looks like a crude hack to me.I'd say vte has to implement real time logging, unless there are any other ideas?I don't need real time logging in g-t anyway, i would be happy if vte just implemented something like Bug 348342 , which is a dependency for the scrollback save patch i attached.++The current patch (2006-01-09 14:08 UTC 9.16 KB) methodology seems to work, but a more sophisticated approach would be better. Have you ever used Trilian? (I used it for AIM back in my windows days - gosh its over now.) Each session would be logged automatically to files which had dates, or you could explicitly save a session.I think a good idea is there will be a logging directory, some dot directory off the ~ directory. Each time one opens a tab, it would create a file with the name <current date>.log. (If desireible, instead of a flat logging directory, there would be a setting to have it log as <year>/<month>/<current date>.log). Every 64k (or what turns out to be an efficient buffer size) that is written on the terminal screen, the file would open and be appended. There would be an option such as ""off the record"" where any input or output would not be logged. I use tee sometimes to record the output of my command, but sometimes I like to know what I actually typed, so this logging method would record whats on the terminal screen (which is both input and output). There should be another switch to explicit log any keybord input so you can see where you hit <ctrl> + c, or any other key, or if you typed a password. (Of course, for security, this option probably should be off as its default state.) Finally, it should make a note of when a program like nano or vi is opened since you can't really save the ""text"" of that program.I'd be happy to try and write this. But, I'm wondering if people think it is a good idea, or does anyone else want to write it so we don't waist each others' time? Let me know what you think.++That logging directory would *definitely* have to be optional, otherwise I'd fill up my ~ directory ever so quickly with how much I work on the console and how often I type ""dmesg"" and stuff like that. And then, I think it'd be fairly useless because it'd have to default to *off* and people would only remember to turn it on when it's too late already...++Thats is true. I Imagine that I would fill up my ~ too. You could have three options: Log everything (described in my last post), Log session(s)/tab(s) if requested, absolutely no logging.Log if requested: each open session/tab would write to a file (same way above off the ~), but if the user did not tell it to log this session, the log would be discarded on a successful exit gnome-terminal. This is good too in case something crashes, then you still have logs of what happened prior to the crash. This way, as long as you did not close the session its not ""too late."" Your dmesging or catting a log may get up to a few megs per session, but as soon as you exit (assuming you didnt specify to log it) will just be purged.++Sorry to put a spanner in the works, but I myself only need one thing: save everything in the scrollback buffer to disk.The alternative is a long slow laborious copy and paste.++Created attachment 101483  [details]  [review] (Incomplete) Start of a logging patchThis incomplete patch is to enabled logging for each terminal session. There are 2 logging modes: Enabled, and On Request. Enabled, will log everything as text comes out. On Request means that you have to click ""Start Logging"" to begin logging. On either method, you can choose to ""Pause Logging"" and ""Resume Logging"" (incase you have sensitive material or for any reason you choose). If you choose the On Request option, there is a sub option to log anyway, but unless you choose to keep the log, it will be discarded on exit. This is here for two reasons: 1) if you start something and later on decide you need it to be logged all you have to do his click ""Keep log on exit"". 2) If your system crashes, you have a log of the last thing that terminal was doing. This patch is incomplete. I'm wondering if anyone can offer suggestions or help with the code. The biggest problem is that It can't handle backspaces when you erase what you've typed, or alter text of already typed stuff. This code is in the terminal-screen.c file in the function terminal_screen_logging_ti_callback, which is a callback for ""contents-changed"" on a VteTerminal.++Any chance this over 8 year old request can get done? This seems like a very basic function. Please consider adding it for future releases!I have used konsole for a few years just because it can log your session.

Of course, if what you want to do is ""view"" a document in braille,that won't help you since the text being viewed needs to be in UTF-8 using thebraille dot unicode characters, i.e. it needs to have been ""translated"" tobraille by some external entity.What problem are we trying to solve here?Paolo : I suspect that the problem is with the font, not gedit.  transferringback to gnopernicus, since gnopernicus is the product that installs the braillefont (I am guessing something in the font data tables is broken).++I agree that the Braille font is broken (see bug#140192 ), in that the upper-casecharacters appear to have the wrong dot patterns.

Easy to reproduce by typing a single letter matching lots of mails (""r"" for me), waiting 5 secs and removing it: the spinner continues as well as the query (but it never finishes).2) (not sure here) when you modify the search text and the previous search is not finished, the new one is never triggered. Indeed you must type fast enough (<100ms probably)These 2 items make me wonder if cancellable actually works for: > imap-db-search-folder.vala:197> private async void do_search_async(Geary.SearchQuery query, Gee.Collection<Geary.EmailIdentifier>? add_ids, Gee.Collection<ImapDB.SearchEmailIdentifier>? remove_ids, Cancellable? cancellable) throws Error"" I am not much confident with vala so I am unsure how it's supposed to work, and since the vala documentation ( http://www.valadoc.org/#!wiki=index ) is broken, it makes quite hard the debugging.Still investigating though, since this bug is quite annoying in order to fully use Geary yet.++Looking at this a bit, I may have figured out how to reproduce this.1. Perform a search that causes a ""Error highlighting search results"" message to be reported in the debug log. The specific text string will vary depending on your database, but if you follow the steps in the description above you should come across it2. Perform one more search after that - it should hang. Interrupting the process at that point should reveal a thread calling SQLite fts3* methods, and further down that same stack be executing in imap-db-account.vala (for me on line 1340).I have a feeling that the SQLite error in the first step is causing subsequent FTS queries to hang.++Oh PS: http://www.valadate.org:8000/ is working a bit better than valadoc.org at the moment.++I never have any ""Error highlighting search results"" error but that's one way to have a deadlock I think.I executed my problematic request directly within sqlite3 ( http://pastebin.com/sUCDxNMC ) and it hung for more than 10 minutes (obviously, d* is a pretty vast regex!). Either geary should not search for single characters regex OR maybe we should use a timeout ( https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/busy_timeout.html for instance?) to avoid these endless requests?++> maybe we should use a timeout Nevermind that's already in use and that's the thing that has an issue on my side I believe. Reducing it from 60 sec to 5 sec, I get the same unrecoverable errors: >  [deb] 13:26:53 2,707434 db-connection.vala:407: Connection.exec_transaction: Unable to commit transaction: (Connection.exec /home/xxx/.local/share/geary/ xxx@damsy.net /geary.db) [err=5] - database is locked (COMMIT TRANSACTION) [deb] 13:26:54 1,277926 imap-engine-minimal-folder.vala:641: Fetching STATUS for remote Gmail: xxx@gmail.com :INBOX (open_count=1 remote_opened=true) from local [deb] 13:26:54 0,001555 imap-engine-minimal-folder.vala:645: Fetching information for remote folder Gmail: xxx@gmail.com :INBOX (open_count=1 remote_opened=true) [deb] 13:26:54 0,000049 imap-engine-minimal-folder.vala:649: Opening remote folder INBOX [deb] 13:26:54 0,133552 imap-folder.vala:197: INBOX EXISTS 9289 [deb] 13:26:54 0,000129 imap-folder.vala:232: INBOX RECENT 0 [deb] 13:26:54 0,000577 imap-engine-minimal-folder.vala:182: Gmail: xxx@gmail.com :INBOX (open_count=1 remote_opened=true): Begin normalizing remote and local folders [deb] 13:26:54 0,002025 imap-engine-minimal-folder.vala:288: Gmail: xxx@gmail.com :INBOX (open_count=1 remote_opened=true): No messages added/removed since last opened, normalization completed [deb] 13:26:54 0,031774 imap-engine-email-prefetcher.vala:115: Listing all emails needing prefetching in Gmail: xxx@gmail.com :INBOX (open_count=1 remote_opened=true)...

By the way, I think it should fix yours too Mike because before running it, I got: > insert into MessageSearchTable(MessageSearchTable) values('integrity-check');> database disk image is malformed So the solution is, I believe somewhat related to database vacuum:1) we may invoke 'integrity-check' at geary startup for instance, and in case of error we should invoke 'rebuild' and recheck integrity?2) there is also a 'optimize' command, maybe it would be useful to run it from time to time if there is no integrity check for instance?Anyway rebuilding my database reduced the request d* time from … eternity? to < 200ms!++For info, here's what the rebuild reduces: > select count(*) from MessageSearchTable_segments; //13932 vs 4118> select count(*) from MessageSearchTable_segdir; //202 vs 66++(In reply to Gautier Pelloux-Prayer from comment #7 ) > OK, I finally investigated this and found somethings: Gautier, as we like to say down under, you are a legend! Running the rebuild fixes the issues I was seeing as well.Now that you point out those commands, it seems from the docs that the custom tokenizer changes Geary makes may be the cause Bug 765515 .From the docs, it also seems that these commands could be long running. So it would be good to get a sense of whether these can be run on a regular basis and/or in the background, or if they should be done infrequently.The optimize command is explicitly mentioned as being expensive, so may be only worth doing when Geary intermittently executes a VACCUM at startup.We should ensure that any DB migration scripts that alter the tokenizer also run the rebuild command. It would also be worth adding in a new DB version that does a rebuild for everyone anyway, since a number of users will be suffering this problem.Finally, it would be good to get some timings of how long it takes to run integrity-check on large databases, to see if it's feasible to run at every startup. It might be worth recruiting people on the mailing list with large databases to time running it.For me, on an SSD, with a warm cache, it takes from ~0.3s for a 655MB account database through ~2.1s for a 3.5GB database, which might make it a bit too slow.++Gautier, you rock!Search became totally unusable for me in the last month (the only thing working was the ""search message from this user"", introduced by GTK+).Now it works again.Here's what the rebuild reduces for me: > select count(*) from MessageSearchTable_segments; //8554 vs 3357> select count(*) from MessageSearchTable_segdir; //165 vs 90++Hmm, strangely for me today I cannot execute these commands anymore. > insert into MessageSearchTable(MessageSearchTable) values('integrity-check');> Error: database disk image is malformed> insert into MessageSearchTable(MessageSearchTable) values('rebuild');> Error: database disk image is malformed> vacuum;> Error: database disk image is malformed (done on a backup .db file).Also my geary.db for Geary is (again!) corrupted, less than 12hours after rebuilding it… it might be due to Geary, or maybe my environment.I am not sure what's going on yet, so maybe we should wait a bit before asking benchmarks on the mailing list!++Yeah, you're right. Mine were pretty quicky re-corrupted as well.A few more data points below. These were made by doing a rebuild, starting Geary, making the observation, then quitting Geary and doing an integrity-check.1. The problem doesn't seem to be Geary.ImapDB.Account::populate_search_table_async - commenting that out still sometimes yields a corrupt MessageSearchTable.2. I have not observed MST becoming corrupt if no new messages are received.3. I have observed MST becoming corrupt after some new messages are received, but not others:  a) One message I received that did show a corrupt MST afterwards was a reasonably lengthy HTML spam. Forwarding that to another account afterwards also yielded the other account's DB becoming corrupted.  b) I also sent myself a few short, terse, text/plain messages that after receiving them did not end up with a corrupt MST.++4. I just received some more HTML email that didn't yield a corrupt MST, so it's not HTML that is the problem.I'll see if I can work out what's up with that particular message in 3a.++Created attachment 337549  [details]  [review] Workaround for the problem that may mis-index your messagesOkay, think I've found the source of the bug.For most messages appended to a folder, one of the UPDATE statements (for the subject, from or cc/bcc) in Geary.ImapDB.Folder::do_merge_email_in_search_table() will cause the FTS table to be corrupted. This makes it seem like a SQLite bug, and I've reported it to the SQLite developers.A workaround is to instead of performing the UPDATEs, just drop the row and re-INSERT it. The attached patch does just that, however it may cause messages to be incorrectly-indexed, so I would suggest only using it to verify it fixes the problem for you at the moment.I'm not too familiar with this part of the engine codebase, but strangely it seems that when a message is appended to a folder by the server, after Geary adds it to the FTS table it then also updates it once or twice as well. When adding the message for this first time, all FTS fields are blank, and they are subsequently filled in by latter updates. It would be good to work out if some of these can be avoided to reduce the file I/O overhead.++Created attachment 337679  [details]  [review] Proposed workaround for master/geary-0.11I'm proposing this as the official workaround to prevent the FTS table being corrupted.Guys, can you try applying this and let me know if stops the FTS table from being corrupted further?

The three-letter role (e.g., PBT, RAD,CHK) appears in upper-case text, which is fine.  The Braille dots for thoseupper-case letters are wrong.  They don't correspond to the 6-dot lower-caseletters in any discernable way.All upper-case Braille characters in the monitor are wrong, not just those inthe 3-char role.  Lower-case chars appear to be correct.  I don't know what'sactually sent to the physical display, so maybe this is a problem only with theBraille font.++I checked this issue and I believe this is a problem only with the Braille font.Same information is sent to both, braille device and braille monitor, and theupper-case Braille characters in the braille device are correctly represented.But the braille dots for these letters are different in braille monitor.I also checked the braille 'alphabet' using Character Map (gucharmap) applicationand I saw that the braille dots for the upper-case letters don't correspond tothe 6-dot lower-case letters. But the 'Character Map' braille representation forupper-case letters is identical to their representation on braille monitor...Why does this distinction occurs ?++Marking 'AP3' as this doesn't directly affect end-users of gnopernicus.  Wouldmark even lower, except that it could make the product look bad in demos.++Gnopernicus displays the dots in braille monitor using a font. It doesn't makeany conversion between the utf-8 character and dots. This conversion takesplaces when gnopernicus displays something on a braille device. This is thereason why braille and braille monitor can display different information.A solution is to change the font used by braille monitor. Braille is usingtranslation tables to convert a character from utf-8 to dots, so, a font todisplay same information as braille on the braille monitor will be never found.The solution is to display same dots as braille (using utf-8 characters statingwith U+2800). This is not so easy because braille and braille monitor are now 2processes in gnopernicus.At the begining, the purpose of braille-monitor was to show (for a sight user)the information displayed on braille, but not converted in dots. After a while,the ""braille mode"" was introduced, and implemeted as a simple showing, but usinganother set of characters.++*** Bug 116951 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++It appears that fixing the font will only fix part of the real bug: that BrailleMonitor doesn't show the actual dot patterns rendered to the Braille display. Probably the only way to truly fix this is to introduce new functionality intoBrailleMonitor to receive and render 8-dot dot patterns directly.  This is asignificant chunk of work, and may not be appropriate to undertake at this time.++I suggest that we simply remove the Braille font, since the full fix is muchmore complex than making the upper-case letters appear correctly in Braille.  Inaddition to removing the font, the Braille Monitor Preferences should alsochange: the ""Mode Type"" is not needed and should be removed.++Patch applied to CVS++Created attachment 27842  [details]  [review] proposed patch"

I agree it should not be possible to detach a tab via drag and drop.++The feature is useful - it needs fixing not removing. That being said though, the current situation is aggravating. A gconf configurable delay or minimum mouse movement pixel count would be good.++Agreed, there should be a delay and importantly the ability to switch it off completely as lagged mouse actions seem to be annoying some people - i'd quite like an actual response from devs on this?++It's good idea to fix it. Delay configuration should be placed in control panel - in mouse settings.++I think that this feature needs no delays, no minimal movements, but only an implementation fix: Clicking to tab, release the button and quicky moving the mouse pointer away must never detach the tab.Mouse position must not be evaluated in time when the callback is executed, but it must use mouse position from the moment, when mouse button was released.++I'd also like to confirm this bug.  I work almost exclusively with gnome-terminal and several times a day, a tab gets detached (usually during some critical moment) simply by switching to another tab.For example, I click onto another tab and immediately after doing so, the tab detaches itself and becomes its own window.  I do not have any tab detaching hot keys defined nor did I click on ""detach tab"". I cannot repro this bug on demand and I don't know what causes it.++I'm glad I'm not the only one with this problem.

That's not the origin of the event_window with respect to the widget's window.Finally, in gtk_notebook_motion_notify() you changed-      check_threshold (notebook, priv->mouse_x, priv->mouse_y))+      check_threshold (notebook, event->x, event->y))If you remove the use of gdk_window_get_pointer(), then that won't be necessary.++(In reply to comment #38 ) > Text selection dilatory evaluation of button release can be reproduced in> gtk2-2.14.4.

Unfortunately that is currently not the case.For PR3 we made a band aid fix that changed the most extreme use of preferneces(in tight loops) to use callbacks.  This is a messy way to solve the problem andit requires all users of preferences to have to decide whether to use callbacksor not.Having the rule that its free to peek preferences is good.

79205,gedit,general,Accesibility bugs,"1. There is a check menu item ""View->Customise Toolbar->Show tooltips "".This is checked when tooltip is shown and unchecked when tooltip is not tobe shown. Control F1 has not effect on it. The state of this  widget should be affected by Control <F1> key press.2. The ""Use default font"" checkbutton should be checked in in thepreferences dialog.++1. If this button is checked then a tooltip is shown when you put themouse over a toolbar button.2. Since I want that the default font is monospaced then it must beunchecked by default.++Another Possible Issue with Theme Compliance :-> Start gedit with the ""Use default font/colors"" enabled, the displayarea where the text appears is as expected.  -> Disable the option ""Use default font/colors"" and set bg to red andforeground to black.  The text is redrawn respecting the theme.-> Now enable the option ""Use default font/colors"", the display areashould have the default font size and bg & fg colors from the theme,but the bg = white and fg = black no matter what the theme is. and thefont is also not correct.At this point if the file is closed and opened again, it appears withthe correct theme setting. It seems to be some problem with repaintingthe display area.++Paolo,Regarding item (1) reported in this bug, when the ""View->CustomiseToolbar->Show tooltips"" is checked, tooltips for widgets on thetoolbar is displayed.If you press <Control><F1>, then the tooltips are no longer displayedeven if the ""View->Customise Toolbar->Show tooltips"" check menu itemis checked on. In effect, via <Control><F1>, we have swictched off tooltips display.We can turn it on again by pressing <Control><F1> again.What I am saying is, perhaps the ""View->Customise Toolbar->Showtooltips"" check menu item should be checked/unchecked accordingly. IMHO, since <Control><F1> is available to control tooltip display, wedont need a specifc check menu item in the View Menu.But, if we do retain the check menu item, then a <Control><F1> keypress will 'turn off' tooltips and accordingly we could uncheck the(if) checked menu item.Regarding item (2) reported in this bug, What if we have a challenged user ( with perhaps special visual needs) who after setting up his system theme to have a particular fontstarts gedit?Gedit would be against his theme setting and he would have toexplicitly go to ""Edit->Preferences"" to alter this.But if the feature of the application is to have monospaced font asdefault, then I guess the usability suggestion need not beimplemented.++The theme compliance issue recorded in this Bug is not reproducible.No fix needed.++I fixed it two days ago++Point 1. ok, now I have understand the problem. If you have time,could you please send me a patch for it? Point 2. I prefer to have monospaced font as default since normallytext editors have this default.++Hema: are you going to work on point 1?++Oops!  Sorry. I was under the impression that I had already annotatedthe bug.I am attaching a patch here, which does the following,On pressing ""<Cntl>F1"", a key press handler is invoked that willcheck/uncheck the ""Show Tooltips"" menu item depending upon its currentstate.What it doesnt do is affect the ""show/hide tooltip"" state for thewhole GUI when the check menu item ""Show tooltip"" ischecked/unchecked. That is, the ""Show tooltip"" check menu-itemtoggling should be like a ""<control>F1"" key press.And while we can handle the ""check/uncheck"" of the menu item eventthrough a handler, I dont know how to propogate the event to hide/show tooltips overall for the application.

[ http://bugzilla.gnome.org/showattachment.cgi?attach_id=17022 ]* Additional Comments From Owen Taylor 2003-06-01 02:55Regarding 2. - it seems that your change disallows below-base-formsfor all characters, which can't be right, can it?In a brief look, perhaps the problem is that ""reph"" is notbeing done for U+9AC, which I believe, as the Bengali Rashould be getting it?If I make the change of U+9AC from _cb (consonant with below-base,to _rb, consonant with below base and reph), I get the imagethat I've attached above. I have no idea if this is corrector not, though at least there are different results for thetwo sequences....(If this change is correct, then ICU needs it as well.)* Additional Comments From Taneem Ahmed 2003-06-01 03:13U+9AC should be _bb (right now in CVS it is _bb not _cb). Reph is only for U+9B0. I am attaching two screenshots with _bb and _rb. As you can see for _rb the result is the same, which is not correct. The result should be as produced by _bb. * Additional Comments From Owen Taylor 2003-06-01 04:04For 2, OK, my change wasn't right .... I really don't knowanything about Bengali, as you can tell :-). So, do wehave any idea *what* is going wrong? The output of indic_ot_reorder, with the features *not*applied is: U+99C U+9AC U+9CD U+9A6 dist  dist  dist  dist rphf  rphf  rphf  rphf bwlf              bwlf half              half pstf              pstfTracing through TT_GPOS_Apply_String, the features thattake effect are first, the middle two characters arecombined into a ra-below-base form by 'blwf', thensecond, 'blws' combines the first and second glyphs.Eric would have know better, but I'm wondering if theproblem isn't simply that the features are supposedto be applied syllable by syllable and we're doingthe whole string at once.* Additional Comments From Taneem Ahmed 2003-06-01 04:54For 2, the problem is with the tags. Consider the following two inputs: U+99C U+9AC U+9CD U+9A6 U+99C U+9CD U+9AC U+9A6  After reorder, both should be (and is): U+99C U+9AC U+9CD U+9A6  The difference is in the tags. For the first case, we should have blwf_p for U+9AC U+9CD. With out the patch I proposed, pango sets blwf_p by default to everything, as result to the second case too. * Additional Comments From Owen Taylor 2003-06-01 10:49About 2, one concern would be a case where you have a subscript form beneath a dead consonant (C + virama + C_below + virama + C)or devanagari ra, this is described in R8 of theUnicode book's Devanagari section (Chapter is availablefor download from http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ .)R8 is specifically mentioned as applying to other subscriptconsonants for Gurmukhi in the Unicode chapter as well.So, you only want to supress blwf on the *first* consonant of the syllable, not on all pre-base consonants.So, something as simple as: gulong tag = (i == baseLimit) ? half_p : blwf_pmay be right, but I'd really like to get Eric Mader to look at this before we change things, since this affectsall Indic scripts.* Additional Comments From Taneem Ahmed 2003-06-01 16:50And your suggestion ""gulong tag = (i == baseLimit) ? half_p : blwf_p"" does work.++Filed as ICU bug: http://www.jtcsv.com/cgibin/icu-bugs?findid=4025 change committed:Fri Jul 30 13:33:49 2004  Owen Taylor  < otaylor@redhat.com >         * modules/indic/indic-ot.c (indic_ot_reorder): Suppress        blwf on the first consonant in a syllable.

102965,metacity,general,Keyboard workspace switching causes inconsistent focus,"I use keyboard-based workspace switching and focus-follows-mouse with noautoraise.  When I switch workspaces, metacity seems to arbitrarily decidewhich window gets focus in the new workspace; it does not seem to be basedeither on mouse position (which makes the most sense, since I'm using FFM)or on which window last had focus in that workspace.For instance, if I have three terminals each in two different workspaces,and am in workspace 1 with focus on the terminal in the top left corner, ifI change out of and then back into workspace 1, the top left terminal doesnot necessarily have focus anymore.  In a number of ways, the lack ofconsistency is the most frustrating aspect.I think that the behaviour should be changed so that if FFM is used, thewindow that the mouse is over has focus (this is how every other windowmanager I've used functions, and I think is the way that makes the mostsense), and if FFM is not used, then the window that most recently hadfocus should retain it (I am not particularly attached to this feature; Iwill use FFM until the day I die, and so will leave it to those who care todecide how to implement focus in an non-FFM environment).I believe that this has something to do with the popup that appears whenswitching workspaces with the keyboard; it steals the first click/keypress,and I think that it also messes with focus a bit.++I just tested this with a current CVS checkout and it appears to beworking.++Right, I put in a hacky fix for this. Forgot to close the bug."

The goal at http://live.gnome.org/SessionManagement/NewGnomeSession says ""Isolate the XSMP code as much as possible, and make it possible to replace it with D-Bus over time"" that implies the developers want to move away from XSMP to dbus.But further down the line, it says ""XSMP clients can be matched to autostarted apps by a number of means: .."" that seems to say XSMP still place a role in sessionning.I have these queries:- Is there a known dbus mechanism to response between applications and gnome-session? That is, does applications need to set up a particular dbus channel to talk to gnome-session?- How much of XSMP will be retained by gnome-session going forward?I am trying to figure out what need to be done to have session saved and restored. But the first question I hit against the wall, where is the session information is going to be saved to and in what form?Can $HOME/.gnome2/session be used? That file is tightly linked to gnome-client in libgnomeui, will that still survive going forwards?Is there someone that I can talk to, through irc or e-mail on the above questions?THANKS!++I think session saving would probably need to be done by writing out desktop files in ~/.config/autostart++Ray, I realised that session saving can write to ~/.config/autostart, but the problem there is desktop does not provide granularity of window's geometry (correct me if I am wrong). Hence when they are restored, the application windows tend to stack on top of one another.Also that does not allow applications to be restored onto workspace other than 0.++To be more precise, the desktop file specification does not allow the specification of window geometry nor worksplace placement, so there is no mean of restoring applications to the position required.

Any comment/insight to> this? Maybe http://blogs.gnome.org/metacity/2008/03/08/session-management/ has some insight.Regarding saving sessions in new gnome-session with desktop files, doesn't dumping stuff to some autostart folder mean having to clean up, generate and dump desktop files every so often, which sounds icky to me? I have in mind the subfeature of session saving in GNOME-2.22 - save session at logout. This also used to save the session periodically to restore it in case of a full crash, power loss, etc.++The links made an interesting read, I noted ~/.metacity contains geometry information about application windows. Though I have never seen it been used long before 2.24.0 release. So according to the spec, since window manager starts at phase 2 (or window manager phase) and assuming the phases are well controlled, that is the apps are started /up and running before the next (though I suspect they are spawn asyn), hence there may be time when an apps started before metacity is able to place it. Looking at the gnome apps, class seems pretty well specified. That may be the one to use by metacity.I didn't realise that the sessioning stuff is that extensive. Now that GNOME wants to move on from XSMP (even with the above blog), have anyone a complete architectural view of the whole desktop in terms of session management?What roles each component play:- gnome-session- window manager- toolkit- applications++2.24.1 is released with this major regression on board.Is there is a plan to backport/re-enable session managment in g-s?Would great to have some statement, to know when upgrading to GNOME 2.24 will be possible.++Fryderyk: Yes, obviously, because this bug is still in open state and 2.24.1 release was on Wednesday.

I know that old gnome-session used gnome_* functions to read and write that file, but new gnome-session uses g_key_file_* functions to read it; thus my assumption was that GKeyFile can also be used to write it. But maybe I am wrong there. > Meanwhile, I must say Danny, you are doing some good works to fill the gap :) Thanks :)++(In reply to comment #30 ) > (In reply to comment #29 )> > Does the new session infrastructure even have the features of the old one?

Is there a way to tell it not to wait for a program to exit, or respond, that it's just an application that's not aware of this new infrastructure?It seems like there's alot of MUST's in this system that apply to applications that are not a part of gnome, or even legacy applications that will never be updated. There needs to be some way to squeeze them into this process.++(In reply to comment #33 ) > So it seems like the common use case about 90% of the time is that a user wants> a particular program running whenever they're logged in, in the background. It sounds that in this case, people should just use the autostart specification (use the session capplet to add programs that should be started on login)++Except that there's then no way of ensuring that any one program starts before another. In order to participate in that discussion, applications have to support gnome's new way of doing things, or face second-class status to the session manager.++This is not a change from gnome-session 2.22; if you wanted to use the ""priority"" mechanism to control startup order in 2.22, you needed to use XSMP to register with the session manager.In fact, 2.24 makes your life *easier*, in that there are now three ways for early-launched apps to communicate with the SM: XSMP, D-Bus, or (for programs launched in the Initialize phase), just exiting with status 0.++(In reply to comment #33 ) > So it seems like the common use case about 90% of the time is that a user wants> a particular program running whenever they're logged in, in the background.> Count me as one of the 10% then. I have an arrangement of terminals that I want to keep across sessions. In 2.22 (and as long back as I can remember, I used gnome from before 1.0) this just works. Having the SM just start gnome-terminal only gives me one terminal, in a random location, not 4 in the place I left them. This is only one example, I also like to keep epiphany and evolution open on desktops 7 and 8, when I log back in with the old SM, they appear on the desktop I left them. Please fix properly! This has *always* worked in the past, and in all the other desktop environment this still works.If any of the gnome devs care to mentor me on this, I'd even implement this myself.++(In reply to comment #36 ) > This is not a change from gnome-session 2.22; if you wanted to use the> ""priority"" mechanism to control startup order in 2.22, you needed to use XSMP> to register with the session manager.

How are the apps be orders in relation to XSMP and> D-Bus? The ordering is determined by the .desktop file keys, as mentioned before. XSMP and D-Bus are just two different ways for the app to communicate with gnome-session after it has been started.++I'm another of those people who wants a specific size and layout of gnome-terminals -- I use 2 windows, each with 4 tabs, at specific locations and sizes. Just want you to know there's more than one of us.++I'm another one of those people that found this feature exceedingly useful. So useful that I postponed upgrading most of my machines when I found out about this bug.I use(d) this feature extensively at work for example (or for school work at home) so that I can come back the next day and have all my windows open and ready for me to dive right back in to work. Multiple terminals, Gedit with multiple files open and Firefox with multiple tabs, all as I left them the day before. It greatly helped/helps my workflow.++The fallout from this bug is even worse.  On my dual-head system I created two extra panels that mirror the default panels and put them on monitor 2.  Now when I logout and log back in, I end up with the 4 panels on monitor 1 stacked over/under each other.gnome-session-2.24.1-3.fc10.i386gnome-panel-2.24.1-3.fc10.i386Or am I mistaken and this is actually a different bug?  Can others confirm this?  It may even be possible to replicate on a single-head system with non-default panels.++(In reply to comment #42 ) > Or am I mistaken and this is actually a different bug?  Can others confirm> this? This is a different bug, probably a panel bug.++I've got to install Xubuntu to retrieve the function. I hope the bug will soon be corrected.++This is a major regression.  How did this slip in?Here's yet another distro-specific bug for Fedora: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=471980++I would also echo the comments above ( comment #37  comment #40  comment #41 ), I always used session management as a *complete* management for the entire set of apps that supported it which included all of my regular apps: gnome-terminal, galeon etc. (didn't use any non-GNOME apps like Firefox etc.).  I think the proportion of users using it this way is more than 10%.It all worked fine up until this release of GNOME (everything got saved and restored).  In fact it was one of the features in GNOME that got Mac users (for example) envious when i showed them.  It's very disappointing that all of session saving on logout completely disappeared in one hit. :-(++This problem was first reported on Sep 15 it's now Dec 17 and still no fix.  I find this feature very useful and because of this serious regression I have postponed upgrading my systems to F10.  What's the hold up? I'm running version gnome-session-2.24.2-1.fc10.x86_64.++Paolo, Manu: Whining does not really help in getting things fixed.""What's the hold up?"" Write the code for it and attach it here.++Andre, this code is present in 2.22, last usable gnome-session release.++Yeah. And the codebase for 2.24 has changed a lot, so the 2.22 code has to be adapted/changed a bit. Just do it, the code is available. *shrug*++No changes are needed to make gnome-session 2.22.3 work with GNOME 2.24.Only change needed to 2.24 codebase is downgrade of gnome-panel to 2.22.2 version (because it uses new super duper shiny DBUS interface). Minor ""package level"" intervention requires vino, but only for vendors with strict package dependencies.So I've installed 2.24 with gnome-panel 2.22.2 and gnome-session-2.22.3 and it seems to work well here. Now, I can enjoy working session management again.Nobody is whining here dear Andre. People are just angry and disappointed that GNOME policy allows to release not finished programs to end users without saying a word about regressions. This is not serious. gnome-session 2.24.x still got2.23.x quality and releasing it was a mistake.++Or you can use gnome-session-2.22 + gnome-panel 2.24 with this patch: ftp://ftp-stud.fht-esslingen.de/pub/Mirrors/gentoo/distfiles/gnome-panel-2.24.2-logout+po.tar.bz2 It is an enhanced version from the one I originally posted in bug #561112 and is forward compatible with gnome-session-2.24 so you get to choose which gnome-session you want to use.Yes it's hackish but gnome-session-2.24 is a no go in gentoo until this situation is fixed.++This is a little bit alarming.  These *shrug*s and the like are not giving me the feeling of urgency that I normally associate with finding a really big regression in a stable point release.I'm sympathetic to a degree, because I work on other projects often criticised for their bugginess.  But even I can't quite imagine letting such a big regression go unnoticed, to the extent that it not only isn't mentioned in the release notes, but isn't awarded an OH MY GOD DID WE REALLY RELEASE THAT when the first reports file in.I would like to think that this happened because an enthusiastic young developer built up a brilliant new design, got half-way through implementing it, then saw it released while unready at an unexpected point -- and the consequent worry is that the more we hound developers on this, the more we put them off developing at all.  That would be a terrible pity, and I think there is an appreciation here all around that a modern replacement for the XSMP could be a great thing.  The error seems to be a management one, rather than a development one.Maybe it's just a question of expectation and taste.  Like a previous poster here, I used to enjoy the fact that session management was one of the few things Linux did unambiguously better than other operating systems.  Now it doesn't, at least for Gnome users -- and it was a shock to me to find that other developers never actually saw it as important in the way that I did.  My world is not exactly torn apart, but it may have been slightly tweaked in a small corner somewhere.  Gosh, maybe my view of that corner of the world was wrong all along.In the mean time, I'm running gnome-session 2.22 and gnome-panel 2.22 quite happily with the rest of Gnome 2.24 on several machines.Chris++This bug was set to ""blocker"" on October 9th, before 2.24.1 was released. It's assigned to Vincent Untz, but I haven't seen any comment from him suggesting this is going to be fixed. If it's not going to be fixed, set it to WONTFIX and be done with it.Vincent: Will this bug be fixed? Even if it means completely rolling back the session code to 2.22, as distributions have been doing, it's critical that it happen if people are to retain confidence in this product's release philosophy.When will it happen? Will we see a 2.24.x release with this corrected? Or will people have to wait until 2.26.x, or later?Dropping backwards compatibility in a 2.x release for something this significant sends the wrong message about the gnome project's priorities.++Somebody fix this shit, the startup is already slow as hell and metacity seems to be complaining delaying the startup even more.++(In reply to comment #40 ) > I'm another of those people who wants a specific size and layout of> gnome-terminals -- I use 2 windows, each with 4 tabs, at specific locations and> sizes. Just want you to know there's more than one of us. I did the same.  Since only Gnome apps seemed to work I just had the Gnome terminal with 3 tabs as my default start up configuration.I also filed a bug (not sure if it was with Sun or if I filed it here in bugzilla) that when you upgrade from an older version of Gnome to a newer one your desktop can be hosed.  An example of this is going from Solaris 10 to Solaris 11.  You must delete the saved information before starting the newer version of Gnome.  In my case it would hang the Gnome session and it had to be killed via an ssh from another system, since the console was then unusable.  I hope any fix addresses such an issue.  If a previous version can't be upgraded to the newer format, then wipe it out and tell the user they must configure their saved session info again.Mike++Ok, taking this hot potato :-)++Great Lucas!

I just commited in trunk the initial support for session saving. It will probably have some issues but I thought it would be better to get some testing before the 2.25.92 release.Some notes:- Some GNOME apps removed session client code as part of the getting-rid-of-libgnome[ui] tasks. Consequently, those apps will not to be ""seen"" by the session saving and restoring;- No session saving support for D-Bus session clients yet. I'll probably have to make some additions to the protocol before implementing this. The D-Bus session management protocol is not considered official yet and most of the apps out there use XSMP for session management anyway. Hence, no big deal here;How you can help:- Get latest gnome-session and try it- Report issues as comments here++Hi Lucas,Did you by any chance test this to make sure it doesn't break GDM?++Will be XSMP clients still supported? If no, are there any plans for the XSMP proxy for the new D-Bus session management? (Actually, XSS proxy for the D-Bus screensaver management would be useful as well and may share part of the code.)++Hi,I tested svn rev 5298. Running apps are restarted (so far tested with gnome-terminal, epiphany, evolution), but:- apps are not restored to correct desktop (evolution, epiphany), this was the case in 2.22 (which I'll use as a reference implementation)- apps are not restored to their original location on the screen, worked in 2.22 - epiphany reports it has crashed, and asks for recovery. Clicking recover opens 2 instances...If there's anything I can do to help, let me know.thx,jos++AFAIK the location and workspace are stored by metacity which has to reload its session.

The code for loading a session is:  1. load default components (gnome-settings-daemon)2. load saved session apps (which will most likely include include gnome-panel, nautilus, metacity, etc)3. load apps in autostart dirs4. load required components (which will not load anything because the required components are already loaded from the saved session)I tracked down this problem and it seems that metacity is not returning a valid restart command.++(In reply to comment #72 )Hi Jos, > I tested svn rev 5298. > > Running apps are restarted (so far tested with gnome-terminal, epiphany,> evolution), but:> > - apps are not restored to correct desktop (evolution, epiphany), this was the> case in 2.22 (which I'll use as a reference implementation)> - apps are not restored to their original location on the screen, worked in> 2.22 Most likely a problem in metacity (as commented above). > - epiphany reports it has crashed, and asks for recovery.

See https://listman.redhat.com/archives/xdg-list/2002-July/msg00095.html for the rationale + make interacting saving work (eg, for gedit). It's not perfect, though -- there's a grab taken by either the session manager or the client that makes it weird. Try it to see.That's still not enough to have things work nicely. The other big bug might be in eggsmclient. Investigating...(there are also some changes that shouldn't be here, namely the debug stuff and the icon size change)++Filed bug 575307 to fix the most visible issue with gedit.++Filed bug 575308 to fix gnome-terminal.++I also tried evince, and it works fine.So, now we're left with: + ephy/firefox showing a restore dialog + metacity not saving the window positionsBoth are related to how we end the session: apps seems to be killed.(there's also my uncommitted patch, which has an issue with the interactive dialog in gedit)++Note to self: I don't think we use the discard command. We probably should do that when we remove the old saved session.Note to self 2: might be worth saving the new session in a temp directory, then discard the old session, then rename the temp directory to saved-session. Sounds more solid.++We're clearly bad for two things: + we don't correctly handle SaveYourselfPhase2Request: we should remember the clients willing to do that, and send them SmsSaveYourselfPhase2 when all other clients are done. + it looks like we just exit when we consider the session finished, without sending a die command to the clients, nor waiting for them...++Created attachment 130627  [details]  [review] Big patchSummary: this makes things work quite well. It'd be great to have people test this in the next 24 hours.I should probably split the patch in multiple parts... Here are the various changes: + add a new end_session_last phase (after end_session), where apps that want to save their state after other apps are able to do so (phase2-stuff in xsmp). For this, we need to track the clients that reply to ""saveyourself"" with a ""I want to save later"" reply; we use next_query_clients for this. + use the exit phase to properly stop all clients, and introduce a new exit_now phase (after exit) which quits now; after a 10 seconds timeout, we move from exit to exit_now. + send the information about session-saving (via GSM_CLIENT_END_SESSION_FLAG_SAVE) to clients + when cancelling the session, correctly destroy the inhibitor dialog first to not go in the next phase (end_session, eg) before going back to running + use ~/.config/gnome-session instead of ~/.gnome2/gnome-session. Not strictly necessary, but I think it's better to go directly with the xdg dir. + fix the inhibitor dialog to look in all the right directories for desktop files, instead of just xdg_data_dirs + use smaller icons in the inhibitor dialog + use the discard commands when deleting an old saved session + enable client interaction when saving and enable client to cancel the logout + various protocol fixes:   - do not send a useless initial SaveYourself on RegisterClient (this sounds wrong, since the app shouldn't save things at this point)   - do not reply to SaveYourselfPhase2Request with SmsSaveComplete   - always send SmsSaveComplete on SaveYourselfDone, and ignore the fact that the client couldn't succeed in saving its state since, well, we can't do anything about it so it shouldn't block the logout++(In reply to comment #100 ) >  + use the discard commands when deleting an old saved session Argh.

Oh well. I put it back.I also made the code a bit more solid when writing the saved desktop of a client by checking it has a restart command, and only saving the discard command if it exists (instead of, hrm, crashing ;-)).And I disabled the use of discard commands for now: it breaks metacity session saving since metacity reuses the same session file.++Created attachment 130632  [details]  [review] Another updateIn the old session manager, we compared the discard commands of the old & new saved entries and we didn't run them if there were a match.I implemented something similar, and it works fine (metacity correctly restores the windows on workspaces again & discard commands are used).++Created attachment 130633  [details]  [review] Yet another updateThere was a crash in some case when saving the session (because of a non-initialized variable)...++Filed bug 575330 for nautilus, with a trivial patch.++Vincent, are you adding back Interact and allowing client to block logout?Also, it is really really late in the cycle for changing core design of the session like this.

While I agree with you here I don't think saying ""now that we've cahnged our minds, screw you current desktop users and screw you third party apps, we'll leave you broken until we come up with a better architecture"" is polite.It's entirely possible to fix the current session handling, create a better alternative (mind you there's no reason they would collide when working in parallel) and mark the current approach as deprecated. Then drop it after one or two cycles so apps get their chance of doing stuff the new way (a GNOME Goal perhaps?).++If vuntz' patch fixes issues from a user point of view and does not make it *way* more work for developers to fix the hereby introduced ""completely broken design"" in the next cycle I tend to get this in, for the sake of user happiness.++what about getting the change in 2.26.1 rather than 2.26 that let some time for testing++(In reply to comment #112 ) > Let's have start a discussion early next cycle and involve the> following: owen, hp, walters, vuntz, lucasr, mccann, halfline (or any other> core developers that have a deep understanding of the issues).

It's far imrpoved compared to 2.24, as othershave pointed out. And if it does things wrong or stuff needs a discussion, we can still change it for 2.28.And if this change needs more testing, I'd say we delay the release until we get it in. Releasing 2.24 without session support was already a big blunder, but releasing 2.26 without it, even though we knew for half a year that it was the most requested feature is just bad engineering and not listening to users.++(In reply to comment #112 ) > (In reply to comment #110 )> > (In reply to comment #106 )> > > Vincent, are you adding back Interact and allowing client to block logout?> > > > Yes.

This major regression shouldn't have hit 2.24 in the first place, and releasing 2.26 without correcting it is, frankly, irresponsible and demoralizing to people hoping to see Gnome adoption increase.++(In reply to comment #124 ) > This is not how we should be making our decisions.

But in the short run there's also users out there. I think it can't get much worse from a user POV. And /me as a user simply don't care about your design as long as it works for me.++(In reply to comment #124 ) > This is not how we should be making our decisions.  Fixing the gaps in the new> design is a better way to spend our time - and sends a clear signal to> application authors. What signal? That they need to implement a new protocol which is not even standardized in freedesktop and uses a GNOME-specific namespace in D-Bus? Do you really think this is going to happen?Furthermore, we currently ship in Debian (quick estimation) around 900 applications using XSMP. Do you have any idea of the amount of work to port even a reasonable subset of these applications? Do you think users can accept that all applications that haven’t be ported aren’t supported correctly? Even worse, do you think you can remove XSMP support in GNOME applications and let them fail when started with other session managers? > This feature was/will be committed after ever freeze> date, without testing, with objections from one of the authors of the code,> despite general agreement among many core developers that xsmp style saving is> broken and provides a poor user experience. Yes, it’s a good thing to replace a broken protocol by another one. But you need to do it correctly: - Get the protocol to be standardized. - Convince other session managers to implement the protocol. - Have a transition time during which both protocols are supported. A transition time long enough to fix hundreds of applications. Yes, that means several years.++Given that XSMP is a mess of bizarre special cases and buggy client implementations, and in the past it has *frequently* been the case that broken clients have caused problems for the session manager (and by extension, the session as a whole), and given that Vincent clearly was not terribly familiar with the gory details of XSMP when he started this, as shown by comment #101 and comment #102 , I suspect there are still bugs in the patch, and there will still be bugs in it on Wednesday. (As a concrete example, I'd suggest that someone test out the patch with Skype running, qv bug 357539 .)OTOH, the worst case scenarios are probably either (a) gnome-session crashes when you try to log out, or (b) gnome-session doesn't let you log out, and you have to killall it or power-cycle. While these would both *look* really bad for us, neither is actually all that different from ""gnome-session doesn't save your session and then kills apps without calling SmsDie()"". So...Vincent, you should read http://live.gnome.org/SessionManagement/NotesOnXSMP :)++(In reply to comment #124 ) > > I'm perfectly fine with discussing the future of session saving.

Fixing the gaps in the new> design is a better way to spend our time - and sends a clear signal to> application authors. I strongly disagree: the clear signal will be sent when we'll have session management in GTK+. And this is the opportunity we'll have to fix things.However, that doesn't mean we should ignore all the already-existing apps. And it's not just about saving a session, but about properly talking xsmp with the clients. Do you really think it's fine to have the session exit while your OOo document hasn't been saved? Because that's what is happening right now. Out of all the possible solutions, the current behavior is one of the worse (if not the worst) we could do.(not arguing about what I do with my time ;-)) > This feature was/will be committed after ever freeze date, without testing, My patch wasn't committed and I'm still unsure what to do with it for 2.26.0.The coder and maintainer in me says ""request a freeze break!"", while the release team member part of my brain clearly knows it's really bad to commit such a patch at this stage. That's also why I asked more people to test this. > with objections from one of the authors of the code,> despite general agreement among many core developers that xsmp style saving is> broken and provides a poor user experience. Sure it's broken and it provides a poor user experience (although I could argue it's not that bad). I think everybody agrees a better solution has to be found in the long term. But we also have to look at what people need now.Did you look at the patch? Nearly all the things that are changes are either needed anyway (xsmp or not) or xsmp-related (so they won't matter in a non-xsmp solution).The only change that is debatable outside of xsmp is the introduction of end_session_last. My opinion is that it's some really small part in the code that can be easily removed in the future if we think it's wrong.++FWIW, I agree with Sebastien and Jon on this.  I realize this is a feature that many people want to see back sooner rather than later.  In fact, it's a feature that they would rather already have had.  But this isn't about the feature.  It's about the patch.  2.26.0 is really, really soon.  There's no way we can be sure the patch even implements the feature. It may seem like it does in broad strokes, but look, we all know from experience that code commited at the last minute without testing is *inevitably* broken code.Applying it for .0 would't be responsible release engineering.  In my opinion, it shouldn't even be on the table.  GNOME has been doing speedy, regular releases for years and years now. We're good at it, and we know better than this.Whether it should be done in the 2.26 series is another question.  And really, if it were decided that shipping in 2.26 was the right thing to do, shipping it in a tarball a month from now wouldn't practically speaking be that much worse than the shipping it in tarball less than a week from now.  Most of the users who really miss this feature aren't going to upgrade between now and then anyway.++(In reply to comment #130 ) > Whether it should be done in the 2.26 series is another question.

In my opinion, Ray, be sure I share your concern but this bug report gained such publicity thatthe release team decision on this matter can't be driven by technicalconsiderations alone, there is some ""GNOME image"" at stake here; that can't beignored, for best or worst.Those patches are currently being tested by many users, and its final inclusion,now, or later in 2.26.x, or in 2.27, will most certainly be decided very late,and it will be a carefully measured decision.++Hi,I can confirm that this patch makes session saving work good enough for me (svn + this patch). The 2.25.92 release is a LOT worse. This patch restores the session for epiphany, evolution, gnome-terminal (I had to downgrade to gnome-terminal 2.22 to make this work, it seems session management in the current gnome-terminal is broken, should I file a separate bug for this?).Please apply this patch, the chance for regression is zero, as the functionality was (and is still in the current 2.25.92 release) completely borked anyway. I find it hard to believe that you are doubting a *working* patch, but don't hesitate to REMOVE functionality that a lot of users depend on, and that most users didn't consider broken in the first place!Jos++I found two issue with the latest patch.1. evolution-data-server process is increased.2. unable to shutdown the session occasionally.++(In reply to comment #134 ) > I found two issue with the latest patch.> > 1. evolution-data-server process is increased.

While it is reasonable to object bug changes in such late stage of the release. It is unreasonable to break a major feature in the first place without a clear timeline road map for the feature! Have there been a estimated timeline roadmap, distros may decide whether to stick with 2.22 for a little while before upgrading. These lines of communication has not been clear.On the technical side while xsmp is broken, there isn't a very clear indicator what is the alternative implementation nor recommendation as such.++(In reply to comment #141 ) > To be fair, this bug has been flagged as a blocker since 2.4. 2.24.++Thanks Andre for the correction.I have created bug http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=575544 and has attached a patch that allow the gnome-session-properties dialog to have the Remember current running application button to save session. Most of the dbus code were copied from tools/gnome-session-save.c. I will also create another bug fro the gnome-session-save bit later.++Hey Vincent, some quick comments on the patch;1. gsm_util_get_desktop_dirs implementation could simply use a GPtrArray instead of doing this calculation of array sizes;2. I still don't see the need for a new EXIT_NOW phase. You can just call gtk_main_quit() when EXIT phase ends (which is what the current code does).3. Re-enabling client interact conceptually clashes with current design (as mccann already commented). The major symptom of this is described by Sebastien: ""gedit prompt for saving the work and wait it also displays the ""the following program is running"" dialog over it"". This means we'd have two user-visible ways of handling ""client not ready for logout"" case.About 3, we have a tricky situation here. Vincent's patch make g-s be more compliant with XSMP protocol. On one hand, this is a good thing because this makes g-s behave just like current XSMP session clients expect and, consequently, makes current session management work better. One the other hand, it clashes with the fundamental advantage of the new session management design that brings a better user experience in my opinion. In order to make the new design actually work with current XSMP client implementations, we'd have to change the way applications manage their state (as pointed by Jon) and not requesting interaction from the user and blocking logout. So, here are three important facts about the 2.26 release: 1. Current XSMP client implementations are not behave the way we want;2. We won't be able to change all major applications to behave the way we want with the new session management design for 2.26. Especially because some of them are not in the GNOME scope (Firefox, OOo, etc).3. The combination of not having applications behaving as per the new design and having a session manager that doesn't follow the XSMP protocol means that users may *lose data* because apps are expecting the user to explicitly save their data on logout.So, here's my super-pragmatic way of seeing this is:1. GNOME Session Manager should support current implementation of XSMP clients until we have a new official protocol in place. By ""official protocol"", I mean a D-Bus protocol that is agreed at least between KDE and GNOME.2. Propose new D-Bus based session management protocol on fd.o asap. Jon made an excellent work on designing and implementing a new protocol in gnome-session. This should be more than enough to start a discussion. The co-located Akademy+GUADEC will be a nice opportunity to discuss and decide this still for 2.28.3. During 2.27.x cycle, we should consider any use of XSMP's Interact as bug in our apps. Having XSMP Interact actually implemented in gnome-session will help us finding those bugs. Also, as soon as we have all our apps not using XSMP interact and correctly handling their state, this will make it much easier to move to the new protocol.Hence, here's a suggested plan:1. Disable session saving on 2.26.0 (as it's not correctly working without Vincent's patch);2. Vincent commits his patch just after 2.26.0 so that it can be tested until the 2.26.1 release;  2.1. If everything goes fine (no major bugs and crashes), we keep the code for 2.26.1.  2.2. If something goes really bad, we disable the code for 2.26.1 and try to fix any major issues for 2.26.2.The major drawback for 2.26 would be that we'll show the inhibitors dialog *and* the logout interaction dialogs on each session client application. Not sure if this would be fixable at this point.++(In reply to comment #144 ) > Hey Vincent, some quick comments on the patch;> > 1. gsm_util_get_desktop_dirs implementation could simply use a GPtrArray> instead of doing this calculation of array sizes; Will do. > 2.

Without the gnome-session dialog, you're wondering what's going on.> I agree with Vinz here, I have often had this case that some app was blocking logout and I was wondering why, and then finding a dialog on another workspace.++Lucas's plan seems very sensible to me.Looking on as an outsider (as a GNOME user, but a Qt application developer) Ithink it's vital to support XSMP until a replacement has been accepted andimplemented across at _least_ GTK and Qt.It would arguably be worse to have support only for a system that a fewprivileged applications use than to have no support at all, because (a) itwould make the behaviour even less predictable for the user and harder to dealwith correctly [if e.g. inkscape asks to save changes but scribus silentlyloses them], and (b) politically it might look like a deliberately unhelpfulpolicy on GNOME's part rather than an mistake made with good intentions as isclearly the case with this bug.Whatever happens, a number of users will continue using programs that are neverupdated to any newer protocol, either for technical reasons or because ofstagnation.  (I have at least one Xlib application myself that works nicelywith XSMP but will likely never use D-BUS.)  But the numbers of these should besmall enough for workarounds like explicit use of autostart to be acceptableinstead... so long as the replacement for XSMP is an improvement in other ways. So I think coverage in the two or three main toolkits should be enough, but Ido think that that is necessary.Whatever the outcome, I'm truly grateful for all the work that Vincent, Lucasand others are putting in to resolve this thorny problem.Chris++(In reply to comment #147 ) > > > 3.

I don't know how much (if any) of this is left in the current gnome-session code, but my original plan was that there would be two separate saved sessions, one for the ""default session"", and one for ""the state at last logout"". Saving the session on logout would only apply to the next login, while saving the session from the capplet would affect the ""default session"". When gnome-session started up, it would first check if there was a saved-at-logout session, and if so, it would resume it *and then immediately discard it*. If there wasn't a saved-at-logout session, it would check if there was a default session, and if so, it would resume (and NOT discard) that. If there wasn't either kind of saved session, it would just load the default session.++That approach breaks on system crashes, as during a running session neither the previous nor the current data is available.I'm not sure what the desired behavior is in this case - restart with last session or with empty session. (I prefer last session.)(Also, I might be reading too much about ext4 problems and applying that knowledge to saved sessions)++(In reply to comment #155 ) > (In reply to comment #154 )> > Hmm, this is a bug.

This is unfortunate, but it's no different from the behavior of laptop suspend/resume in the face of crashes; if I resume my laptop, do some work, and then it crashes and I have to reboot, it reboots to a clean slate, not back to the state it was in when I last resumed. It's not a bug per se, it's just that the model doesn't make any effort to deal with system crashes.If we were going to try to deal with crashes, I think we'd want some way to do ""autosaves"", so that you could actually resume the *current* session state, not the previous state. But XSMP doesn't give us a good way to do this. (It gives us bad ways to do it, but... they're bad.)++(In reply to comment #159 ) > When gnome-session started up, it would first check if there was a saved-> at-logout session, and if so, it would resume it *and then immediately> discard it*.

This would fix> Benjamin's issue, I guess. My preferred behavior for session management as a user is as follows:I would prefer one session file for a manual saved session,and one session file for the ""the state at last logout"",like in comment #159 .The session file for the manual saved session is only deleted on request by the user, or by being replaced by a new manual saved session. The replace should handled by first creating a new manual saved session file with a new (temporary) name and then renamed (moved) to the standard session file name for the manual saved session. Before renaming the file size should be checked that it is not empty (for example because the there was no free space on the file system or the file system quota for the user was reached). Using this method the user should have either the old or the new manuel session file.The session file for the state at last logout should be handled in the same way when an new saved session file is created at logout if the user has requested to restore the last state at logout on the next login. Then there is always a last saved session file even in the case of a crash.If the user changes the preference to not to save the state at logout, then the corresponding last saved session file can be removed immediately.One user interface for saving the manual saved session is the current desktop with the arranged applications on the workspaces. The dialog for saving the session should not be part of the manual saved session.If there would be a graphical interface to show and modify what was saved as the manual saved session would be nice, but it is not so much important. Sometimes there are running some applications and applets in the background that the user doesn't see when he saves a session manually. The list of applications and applets (?) can been shown by such a graphical interface, and it should be possible to remove some of that listed applications or modify them, and manually add applications to the list, and save the new list.But if this can also be done by editing the manual saved session file (if it is a plan text file) and the format of the file is well documented so the user can know how to modify it right, then this may be an alternative for experienced users while there is no graphical interface.++(In reply to comment #165 ) > I would prefer one session file for a manual saved session,> and one session file for the ""the state at last logout"",> like in comment #159 . An addition: The advantage with two different saved state files is that the manual saved session is not lost when the user switches between restoring the session on logout or not.++(In reply to comment #165 ) > The session file for the state at last logout should be handled in the same way> when an new saved session file is created at logout if the user has requested> to restore the last state at logout on the next login. Then there is always a> last saved session file even in the case of a crash. One more addition: Autosaving the current session like suggested in comment #163 can be added to this model.We can also save versions of that saved session state files. The number of version of that files (autosave files, logout session state files, manual saved session files) should be configurable, and if more versions of that files are present then that older versions should been removed automatically so the used disk space remains small and limited.++Gentoo's Gnome overlay included the session-save patch with gnome-session 2.26.0 for testing.With the current implementation, there are gnome-terminal-<timestamp>.desktop files saved in .config/session-state/ that contain the correct information on number of tabs and directories those tabs are in. However the terminal that starts up has a single tab in the home directory. Should that be a separate gnome-terminal bug?Can I assume that once a final direction for session saving is determined, that the older session files will be deleted?I'm also having issues with firefox thinking it has crashed on the prior logout, but I'm also using avant-window-navigator instead of the panel so I don't know if its logout applet is responsible for this. Since the session save info seems to be there for other applications it may simply be firefox not handling the session end correctly.++(In reply to comment #168 ) > I'm also having issues with firefox thinking it has crashed on the prior> logout, but I'm also using avant-window-navigator instead of the panel so I> don't know if its logout applet is responsible for this. Apparently so. Now that an updated gnome-desktop-sharp is available and gnome-do is working again, I can logoout from there and when I login firefox starts normally.The gnome-terminal issue is the same however. I just noticed comment 133 refers to this same issue.++(In reply to comment #168 ) > With the current implementation, there are gnome-terminal-<timestamp>.desktop> files saved in .config/session-state/ that contain the correct information on> number of tabs and directories those tabs are in.

I would think the conclusion here is that if an app is expected to be autostarted, it should either: + not be saved in the session + set a X-GNOME-Provides key in its desktop file to something unique (this way, the saved client will mask the one from the autostart dir on next login)Let's discuss this in bug 576633 .++*** Bug 555990 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++Not sure everyone is aware of what follows (I risk to repeat someone...): In Ubuntu Jaunty (9.04) Beta, at /logout/, the user is asked if he wants to save open documents in gedit, OpenOffice etc. But at /shutdown/ or /restart/, he is not!

I tried to do it similar to what you'resuggesting but ran out of time somewhere between undocumented St toolkit,unfamiliar (or strange) clutter behavior, and CSS selectors that didn't work asexpected. In addition a new widget would need to support keyboard, active, focus,hover and other things I'm sure.

Upgrade gnome-shell to 3.4 and carry a patch to revert this dependency on gcr 3.42. Upgrade gnome-shell to 3.4 and hope that gnome-keyring, which is a critical part of the infrastructure doesn't have too many bugs in the rewrite, which hasn't been tested near as much as the older gnome-keyring.3. Relegate gnome-shell 3.4 and gnome-keyring 3.4 to the GNOME3 PPA where it currently sits, and leave gnome-shell 3.2 and gnome-keyring 3.2 in the ordinary Ubuntu repositories until next release cycle. I think this will be a major disappointment to GNOME developers and users (even though the PPA isn't that hard to use).++You're right. I hope you identify the solution that's right for you.

They just make the changes for bug 774818 more focused.(Patchset for bug 774818 is nearly ready itself).Thanks,Mike++Hi Mike,I just finished reviewing patch set v1 from comment #1 (all 5600+lines).  :-)Most every thing looks good to me from a code review perspective, andall the patches apply and compile.  The comments are helpful, and youcertainly cleaned up some of the more messy areas of the code.So far the only code review thing I found is one minor typo in thecommit comment as identified below:P01/20 Refactor Win_GParted::unmount_partition() (#775932)  CHANGE FROM:    leftover from when the function use to be a separate thread.                                    ^^^  TO:    leftover from when the function used to be a separate thread.I have made this change to my copy in anticipation of committing toour git master.Next I need to test much of the functionality of GParted to gainconfidence that it still works as expected.Curtis++Hi Mike,Because the patch set touches on many areas, there is a lot to test.  :-)I'm tried to test at least one partition/file system with each of thefollowing actions:- Create/delete partition with file system- Mount/umount/swapon/swapoff/activate/deactivate    NOTE:  Activate/deactivate LVM2 PV do not appear to work, not only           with this patch set, but with gparted 0.27.0 as well.           This isn't a regression so does not cause a fail in           regression testing in my mind.    STEPS: 1. Create 256 MiB LVM2 PV (/dev/sdb4) using GParted           2. sudo vgcreate vgtest /dev/sdb4	   3. sudo lvcreate --name lvtest --size 128M vgtest	   4.

I'll need you to debug what isfailing for you.Mike++Hi Mike,Since LVM2 PV activate/deactivate works for you I decided to try this on a few distros.The LVM2 PV activate/deactivate actions work properly on the following:  fedora 24    VMopenSUSE 42.1  VM  Ubuntu 12.04 VM  Ubuntu 14.04 VM Kubuntu 16.04 physical computerI had done my initial run of tests on an Ubuntu 15.10 (wily) VM.  It appears that my Ubuntu 15.10 (wily) VM is the only VM in which LVM2 PV activate/deactivate doesn't work.  This leads me to suspect a problem with the VM.  Because Ubuntu 15.10 (wily) is no longer supported, I think it might not be worth our time to troubleshoot further.  I'll be retiring this VM soon due to loss of support from Canonical.If you have no objections, I will plan to commit the patch set tomorrow.Curtis++Thank you Mike for your continuing efforts to improve GParted.

322348,gnome-vfs,Monitoring (inotify),inotify backend doesn't monitor a symlink to a directory,"If you have a symlink to a directory, and monitor that as a directory you don'tget any changes reported when files are created in the directory.++I can't comment on the details just yet, I need to get reacquainted with thecode. In general the problem is that as far inotify is concerned symlinks don'texist. When you ask inotify to watch a symlink it watches the inode that thesymlink points to. The current code tried to match FAM's handling of a symlink,which was to watch the link and not what was pointed to by it.We should decide on a symlink policy for gnome-vfs. Do we want to be able towatch the symbolic link or do we want to watch whatever is pointed to by thesymbolic link?Consider 'Watch /tmp/foo which is a symlink to /tmp/bar'-We want to know when /tmp/foo is deleted.	We can do this by watching /tmp.-We want to know when /tmp/foo is written to.	We have to watch whatever /tmp/foo is pointing to.	**If /tmp/foo was a regular file, we could accomplish this by watching /tmp.It gets worse if an application also watches /tmp/bar because inotify treatsthem as if they were the same thing.The fix for this bug is to just ignore the fact that we are watching a symlink.So, just watch it with inotify like it is anything else. You will getnotification when files are changed in the directory.I think some scenarios need to be constructed that show the behaviour we want tohave when symlinks are involved.++Lets start with a user interface perspective here. There are twocommon uses of file monitoring in Nautilus, one is the ""display adirectory and keep it up to date"" and one is a ""display the propertieswindow for a file and keep it up to date.For the directory case we're interested in renames/moves/deletes ofthe directory inode (in the case of rename we update things, in thecase of delete we close the window), changes of directory contents(file add/remove/move) and changes to the metadata/contents of filesin the directory (to update file type, file size display, etc).For the properties case we're interested in the file gettingremoved/renamed (meaning we close/retitle the window) and changes ofmetadata/contents of the file (to update properties/type in thedialog). For properties of directories we currently display therecursive count+size but don't monitor it, which i think is sane.Now, in the case where the item in these cases is a symlink to anexisting file we want the same behaviour. The question is, at whatlevel do we implement this similarity.Currently, the way we monitor the folder case is that we have a singlemonitor on the folder. This breaks in the case the folder is asymlink, and i guess it also fails to update if a file in thedirectory is a symlink to a file that changes.The way we monitor for the properties dialog is different though. Wemonitor both the target and the source of the file, so things workeven when the file is a symlink (or a desktop file shortcut).So, do we make the monitoring framework handle the directory case, ordo we handle it in the app. I think a middle road might be usefulhere. We pass a FOLLOW_SYMLINK_FLAG flag (addition to GnomeVFSMonitorType,say ""1<<31"") to the add_monitor call. This then decides whether tomonitor the source or the target. For nautilus watching a folder wethen start both monitors, but for the very common case of file is nota symlink we make sure in gnome-vfs to only actually have one inotifymonitor that is shared by these two monitors.What do you think of this? The only problem it has is the symlink destination offile in monitored folder is missed. But, even that could be fixed, as nautilusdoes have some code to track symlinks (I think).At the same time we can add a SEND_MOVE_EVENTS_FLAG flag so that wecan add move events to the inotify backend. (Other backends continueto send remove+add events even if the flag is passed, its abest-effort thing.)++*** Bug 318999 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++Your suggestion of a flag sounds good. I am working on implementing this now.Could you add those flags to GnomeVFS ?++With my latest commit, sym link directories should work like a real directory.++I looked at the flags idea. Its a bit hard, since the notification callback onlyhas one uri argument. You'd have to use a different type of callback if youspecify that you want move events, which is a bit nasty...++Yep. Sending move events is going to require a new callback function type. Thesymbolic link flag is still doable. I think the default behaviour should be tofollow a symlink. So the flag should be DONT_FOLLOW_SYMLINK_FLAG. This will keepgnome-vfs-monitor backwards compatible.++Changing component to the brand new Monitoring (inotify).++This has been fixed for a while. I will open bugs for the other issues discussed here.++I am using Gnome 2.12.2 and this problem still exists.When I view a symlinked directory, it never gets updated.  I have to manually update it.++This bug does not affect gnome 2.12"

This has the effect, on certainimplementations (of which AIX is one), of overwriting a pointer ""pixbuf""which is declared immediately following text. This in turn provokesattempts to access invalid pointers in routine gtk_tree_store_set_value().By declaring ""text[6]"" the problem disappears, but I am not sure that thereferences to member ""text[5]"" are required (tests show that the monitorfunctions without them).Secondly, there are compiler warnings (I only have AIX to test this) for 2lines 125, 126 where initialisation is a problem (I believe this is ISO C,but cannot find the references) :""gnome-system-monitor/src/callbacks.c"", line 125.34: 1506-221 (E)Initializer must be a valid constant expression.""gnome-system-monitor/src/callbacks.c"", line 126.34: 1506-221 (E)Initializer must be a valid constant expression.This can be overcome by declaring ""const gchar *authors[3];""  and laterassigning ""authors[0] = _(""Kevin Vandersloot ( kfv101@psu.edu )"");"" ,""authors[1] = _( ....);"" , ""authors[2] = NULL;"" .Thirdly, I have also observed that the ""Devices"" display area does not showthe percent free bar when the monitor window is not sufficiently wide.There is a horizontal scroll bar, but it does not scroll far enough todisplay more than the lefthand edge of the percent free bar. Widening thewindow does progressively show more of the percent free bar.++1) Already fixed http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/procman/src/callbacks.c?r1=1.86&r2=1.87 2) you're right. You should get the same kind of warnings in many other places.I can make a patch if you want. Does it worth it ?3) i believe this is fixed in gnome-system-monitor.++For point 2, it is possible that warnings of this cause are present elsewhere.As AIX needed correction for point 1, I also made the modification for thewarning. I am not longer working directly on the Gnome project, but I see mytemporary fix with a ""Bugzilla 134136"" comment is still being carried forward.So, the problem is minor, but it would help us to realign code source if fixed.Thanks.++Fixed in CVS."
437684,tomboy,General,Old-style clipboard shortcuts should be supported,"According to normal UI conventions, the old clipboard keyboard shortcuts (Shift-Delete for cut, Contrl-Insert for Copy, and Shift-Insert for Paste) still are supported just about everywhere - but not in Tomboy, in which Shift-Delete just erases the selected region. It would be nice to have those keys supported in Tomboy as well, since they are very useful for anyone operating the mouse with their left hand.Other information:++Confirmed this bug for Shift+DeleteCtrl+Insert and Shift+Insert appear to work properly, however.I'm running Ubuntu Feisty Fawn, Tomboy 0.7.1I will attempt to patch this bug.++Actually this is true for me as well.

All I did was to check to see if the shift key is being held down whenever the Delete key is pressed. If the shift key is down, then the program bypasses the code defined for the Delete key that was messing up the Cut operation triggered by Shift+Delete.Simple as pie, once I found the bug.++This patch *looks* fine, but it does not work for me.  No matter what I do, this statement is always true:args.Event.State != Gdk.ModifierType.ShiftMaskI've tried with both shift keys.  shift+insert and ctrl+insert work fine for me.

(I've german lang: ""Saldenabfrage"") in a *different* account, I only get a flicker, but no error message. Only in the right account it works.There should be an error message or, even better, the menu shouldn't be there at all or greyed out.++Yes, something should be done here.++I've added it to my list of things to look into...++Related bug:- Open an account (register) page - Select and deselect (Ctrl click) an account on the accounts tree page  so that none is selected- Select previously opened account page again  --> Online actions are inactive even for a valid AqBanking account++The feature request is very valid and I would like to see this as well. I didn't continue implementing this because 1. I didn't understand the gnucash dynamic menu infrastructure well enough to find the callbacks that get called when the selection in the main widget changes (e.g. in the hierarchy you select a non-HBCI account vs. a HBCI-enabled account), and 2. the current implementation defers the initialization of the AB_BANKING object until the action is actually triggered, but I thought querying the existence of a valid HBCI-enabled account requires an existing AB_BANKING object (because old BLZ/Ktonr. mappings might still be stored in the gnucash kvp frame of the accoutn), and that would require changing the initialization / de-initialization of the AB_BANKING in the gncmod-aqbanking module. Or in other words I thought it is an expensive operation to find out whether a gnucash account can be mapped to an AB_ACCOUNT which means the online actions can be enabled. If that can be done as a cheap operation, this feature here of course should be possible.++Created attachment 175974  [details]  [review] Online actions are disabled for accounts which have no bankcode and account id assignedThis fix does not require initialization of the AB_BANKING object.++Comment on attachment 175974  [details]  [review] Online actions are disabled for accounts which have no bankcode and account id assignedr19914, thanks a lot!++Created attachment 176063  [details]  [review] Patch to improve error handling for online actionsShow error message, if assigned online account is not valid or cannot be found or if the selected online action is not valid for this account.

Watch Ubuntu's thread on this bug: https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=7552 Dino wrote that it only happens when you create a folder in your home directory,e.g. /home/$user. I've checked this, and he is right. I am not experiencing anyproblems while creating a folder in another directory.++Found an unreliable way to duplicate it:- start gedit in your home directory- type something- Hit C-s- Open the ""Browse for other folders"" expander- Hit the ""Create folder"" button- ... the uncertainty comes here ... unfocus the window, or just wait a bit- crashThis will only work only if you are in your home directory.What happens is this:When the cell being edited stops editing, the file chooser queues an idlehandler to create the new folder and switch to it.  There's a good reason whyit's done in an idle, but I don't remember the details right now --- I'm sureit's explained in the ChangeLog.1. In the last step, where you unfocus the window, the cell stops editing andthe file chooser calls queue_edited_idle() for the first time.2. We go back to the main loop.3. GConfd changes something under ~/.gconfd, and so the mtime of this changes. The file chooser gets notified about this change.4. The file system model emits row_changed, which eventually gets pick up by thetree view.5. The tree view stops editing because a row was changed (this is ingtktreeview.c:7045).6. Due to this, the file chooser gets notified again that the cell stoppedediting, so it calls queue_edited_idle() again.  Since we already have an idlehandler, the assertion fails.Some thoughts about this:- The tree view should probably not stop editing if the row that changes isdifferent from the row being edited.  This bug mentions this and provides apatch: http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=59669 - The file chooser could probably just monitor the case where the cell editingis *canceled*, rather than terminated in any way, and cancel its idle handler inthat case.

It's really possible to have missing username field on some installs. The difference is simple, when you update from older system to newer, or take your previous setup with google group created, then you do not see this. If you install the fresh new system, no backup restore, then you suffer this.All is because this: http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/evolution/trunk/plugins/google-account-setup/google-source.c?r1=37165&r2=37164&pathrev=37165 and this: http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/evolution/trunk/plugins/google-account-setup/google-contacts-source.c?r1=37165&r2=37164&pathrev=37165 change. Notice the base URI was previously used as ""Google://"", but after change as ""google://"". Which beezly correctly identified. Unfortunately his change might break this for the first group, where this worked fine before. So I committed a little better patch. I noticed that other plugins might suffer this too, but as long as user doesn't play with gconf-editor, nothing happens.In case you cannot wait for a source change, you can workaround this with gconf-editor :) Open key:/apps/evolution/calendar/sourcessearch for line containing ""Google"" near the beginning and change stringbase_uri=""google://""tobase_uri=""Google://""(only capital 'G') and it'll start working as you want.Beezly, please open new bug report for the crasher and provide backtrace of the crash, to be able to track the issue properly.

I assume the control center ones are dependent on the metacity ones going in first. Hopefully the patches are in a state where we can merge them and once and for all end this silly argument with Linus.++let's keep focused on what the patches do, not who wrote them or what flamewars went on. changing title accordingly. There are some related discussions already in bugzilla, probably.++The patches all look pretty sensible to me.  The combined effect is that you can set double click on the menu bar to lower or open a window menu.  No new UI is created except to add those options to the droplist in the control panel applet.Do you think Linus would mind working on some of the other issues listed in Bug 155457 also?++Well actually that's not quite right as it adds middle and right click droplists as well.++Can linus' email also be added to CC list in this tracker bug?++Additionally, could mouse scroll wheel events be bindable as well? Not necessarily by default (stray scroll events may be confusing for some users), but if the other mouse events are to be bindable then scroll up/down (while mouseover titlebar) would be a handy way to shade/unshade windows, for example.++Shade/unshade per scrollwheel would be cool.++Isn't custom functionality like this ideal for Devil's pie [1] instead of metacity itself?[1] http://www.burtonini.com/blog/computers/devilspie++Scroll up/down for shade/unshade is useful. I used to use it in Xfwm. It is easier to scroll a wheel than to double click for me.

A discussion in bug#154614 wants to remove the few options which are already there as they confuse people, while others want more configurability. Perhaps this should be taken as impetus to create a Gnome global Novice/Expert option which exposes the options which should be hidden from easily confused users. It may be true that some new users should not have these options as they might make the interface less windows like and panic, but in my case I found moving to Gnome (from FVWM) rather painful precisely because of the lack of these features. If Gnome is going to take 30% of the desktop market it should appeal to as wide range of users as possible. If people agree then I’ll open a ticket to that affect.++A Novice/Expert setting has been tried before in Nautilus, and it failed. Everyone is just going to set the setting to Expert anyway, because people like to make themselves feel like they are better at something than they actually are. And I think open source inherently creates a much more useful Novice/Expert barrier anyway. The real experts can do whatever they want, because they have the code, and can change it to their liking. The problem here though, is that the upper echelon of the Novice group, thinks the rest of the Novice group should be exposed to options which most people don't need to use, see, or care about. Some Experts also have this same problem.I haven't actually looked at these patches yet though, and I probably won't, based on the simple fact that I know what the current ""advanced"" keyboard options settings looks like in the UI. But just try and get the patches reviewed and committed, rejected, or whatever, rather than arguing about simple vs. complex, novice vs. expert, and all that crap. It's a waste of time, and keeps people from actually making the desktop better.(In reply to comment #12 ) > Obviously there are two camps around the issue of adding user more interface> options.

I have no desire to decide what should happen on single/double/right/middle clicks/scrolls, and I doubt that many people really do.If the current settings dialog was just changed to allow disabling of the built-in actions, and all unhandled actions were emitted somehow, most of us would be able to ignore the whole thing.Ross:Would you count it as within Devil's Pie's scope if there was a way to pick up the events?  That would certainly cover the configurability complaints.++I think responding to mouse events on a window's titlebar is entirely within the scope of a window manager.++Since the remaining open sub-bugs belong to gnome-control-center, they can have the master bug too.++Ping.2.19 has hit feature freeze now.

236044,evolution,Calendar,Appointment times change out from under you.,"Package: EvolutionPriority: NormalVersion: 1.2.1Synopsis: Appointment times change out from under you.Bugzilla-Product: EvolutionBugzilla-Component: CalendarDescription:Description of Problem: It appears that when using Evolution to set aset an appointment start and stop time, it tries to keep the stop timeahead of the start time while you're making the changes. This isextremely frustrating as it can result in you needing to make thecorrect order of changes to keep the termporal relationship correctthroughout the changes.Steps to reproduce the problem:1. Double click on a time to make a default half hour appointment (say2pm)2. Now change the end time to 1pm. Notice the start time has changed tothe previous day at 11:00pm3. Now change the start date back to the current date. Notice the endtime has changed to the previous day at 12:00am4. Now change the start time to 12:00 (the change you were trying tomake originally)5. Now change the end date to the current date. Notice the start timehas changed to previous dat at 11:00pm just like in step 2.Actual Results: You chase your tail trying to keep the end time afterthe start time as you change days and times until you figure out thatyou have to preserve the start before end ordering during all thechanges.Expected Results: I should never have to make more than 2 changes to setan appointment on the same day and never more than 4 if it is on adifferent day.How often does this happen? All the timeAdditional Information: The only reasonable fix is to allow the end timeto be before the start time while the user is making changes. Perhapscheck this and ask the user to fix it when you attempt to save thetransaction.

It does this constantly and make makingappointments next to impossible some times.  Do the checks at the ENDof setting up the appointment rather than trying to fix appointmentsmid-stream.  I have had times where I have set up appointments on thewrong day which has almost caused me to miss things because I didn'tnotice that it started changing dates.This happens in both 1.2 and 1.3++Making it possible to set the appointment to start before it endswould have serious implications for the meeting page, which would haveto show this graphically.The behaviour has changed recently, so it won't move the start of theappointment to the previous day, but rather preserve the duration ofthe appointment. Thus, if you have a duration 1:00pm - 2:00pm andchange the end to be 12:00am, the start will be moved to 11:00am thesame day.I will consider this a fix."

376425,GtkHtml,Rendering,Evolution generally ignores proxy settings,"Forwarding from a downstream bug report: http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=215009 (It was filed against Evolution, but I suspect this is a GtkHtml bug.)Description of problem:Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):evolution-2.8.1.1-3.fc6How reproducible: I am using evolution with evolution-connector to get mail froman OWA server. My Internet access is exclusively through a proxy (I have a localntlmaps proxy that contacts the actual proxy, which most Linux applicationscan't talk to.) All images appear in as red x-es if the messages reside in localfolders. Occasionally, I notice an image that correctly downloads if the messageis residing on the Exchange Server.Steps to Reproduce:1. Set up proxies in System>Preferences>Network Proxy. For good measure set up aglobal environment variable (/etc/profile.d/proxy.sh). For good measure, installgconf-editor to verify that the settings are known to Gnome.2. Make sure that Email Properties (HTML mail) has ""Always download images fromthe Internet"" checked.3. Write a rule to move a newsletter in HTML to a local directory.4. Try to read the message from the local directory.  Actual results: The status bar indicates attempts to download the message, butall images are replaced by red x-es.Expected results: Successful downloading of the images.Additional info: I had the same problem in FC5, but never reported it. (Iswitched to Evolution very late in the cycle -- I had been using Outlook underCrossover Office before, as my organization had no OWA at the time.)++I have the same problem.++Evolution uses settings in /system/http_proxy when downloading images with url like http:// or https://. Can you check what is the image url and if the settings (in gconf-editor) is there? Thanks in advance.++For instance, I have an email with the URL: http://bp2.blogger.com/_utOcD-lSx_c/R0F7tQg22BI/AAAAAAAAACQ/Hfbevaw2Ep0/s1600-h/olsr-vs-user-traffic.png Evolution is not using /system/http_proxy to display the email.  When I do View->Load Images, the email view just freezes for a few seconds/minutes and then times out, as if it tried to load the image without using proxy (the router silently drops port 80 packets, instead of sending back a connection refused).It is definitely NOT true that ""Evolution uses settings in /system/http_proxy when downloading images with url like http:// or https://"".++OK, correction.  I went back to my email window that didn't load images, and I noticed it actually did load images.  I don't know how long it took but it must have been a long time.So probably what happens is that gtkhtml tries to load images directly first, and only if it fails it tries to load via proxy.  However in my case detecting direct http failure can take minutes, and so loading images takes minutes, which is not acceptable behaviour.++Thanks for quick response. Based on the code, it uses settings from there. Your URL doesn't point to real image, but to the page with the image, so it fails to show, you want to change ""/s1600-h/"" to ""/s1600/"" to point to direct image (graph).Anyway, I found a bug in camel when working with proxy, I'll attach here a patch in couple of minutes.

120195,pango,win32,there are some functions in pangowin32-fontmap.c that might maybe should be static,"There are several functions in pangowin32-fontmap.c that are not static butdon't have any gtk-docs, so I wonder if their not being static is amistake. The one I noticed first is pango_win32_family_get_name.pango_fc_family_get_name is static.++As pangowin32 is supposed to be built as a DLL, and there is a pangowin32.def file specifying what entry points to export, it doesn't really matter whether functions are marked as static or not. Only the explicitly exported ones will be visible outside the DLL.But still, just for cleanliness, it's true that those functions that are private to a file should be marked static. Also, those that are private to the library, even if defined in one object file and used from another, should be prefixed with an underscore, as is customary in GTK and Pango. A patch would be welcome...++FWIW, marking private-to-a-file functions as static has more benefits, since thecompiler will generate code that uses local offsets instead of accessing GOT/PLTtables.  The point is that .def file only comes in action at link time, notcompile time.++These eight symbols are not static, do not have gtkdocs, appear inpangowin32.def, are declared in pangowin32-private.h instead of pangowin32.h:pango_win32_font_newpango_win32_render_transformedpango_win32_get_shaper_mappango_win32_make_matching_logfontpango_win32_font_entry_get_coveragepango_win32_font_entry_removepango_win32_fontmap_cache_addpango_win32_fontmap_cache_removeOf those, pango_win32_render_transformed and pango_win32_get_shaper_map onlyappear in one .c file, the rest in more.  I suspect these should be removed fromthe def file, or documented and moved to a nonprivate header.  What am I missing?The following six symbols are not static, not in pangowin32.def, and don't havegtkdocs:pango_win32_get_name_headerpango_win32_get_name_recordpango_win32_family_get_typepango_win32_coverage_language_classifypango_win32_font_entry_set_coveragepango_win32_face_get_typeof which pango_win32_family_get_type and pango_win32_face_get_type are only usedin one .c file.  Should these be made static or prefixed with underscore?++> I suspect these should be removed from> the def file, or documented and moved to a nonprivate header. Hmm, yes. > What am I missing? You are a couple of years late ;-) The pangowin32 DLL is largely irrelevantnowadays, only a part of its functionality is actually used (from libpangocairo,not from GDK or application code). At least I hope so. (And that part maybeshould be copy-pasted into pangocairo-win32font.c, so that the pangowin32 DLLwould be cnsidered obsolete as a whole?) I guess when pangowin32 was originally written (based on pangox*.c) it wasn'tyet that clear (at least not to me) what API was going to be used from theoutside and what not. And later nobody felt the urge to remove private functionsfrom the .def file and/or take care of this bug...++> You are a couple of years late ;-) But the bug was not so old last year!You going to take care of this then? ;)++Yes, at least I can mark the relevant private functions as static or prefix withunderscore. I won't remove anything from the pangowin32.def file, though, thereis the remote chance that something somewhere for some reason might be usingthose functions. (The fact that the functions are declared in a non-installedheader doesn't help. Somebody might be in the habit of including stuff fromsource directories and not from a separate ""install"" location.)++pango_win32_render_transformed needs to be exported. It is usedby gdk-2.6/gdk/win32/gdkdrawable-win32.c. Also it is declaredin pangowin32.h++Finally done:2007-03-10  Tor Lillqvist  < tml@novell.com >	* pango/pangowin32-private.h	* pango/pangowin32.c	* pango/pangowin32-fontcache.c	* pango/pangowin32-fontmap.c	* pango/pangocairo-win32font.c	* pango/pangowin32.def: Move functions defined in one file and	used in another to the file where used, make them static, and drop	from pangowin32-private.h.

(*) This plugin contains the opencore amr codecs, this is why I put it in gst and not in ext.  (*) I joined together the amr-nb and amr-wb stuff in a single amr plugin because they are both based on the same code from opencore, but maybe you prefer having both separated...- Moved documentation related to amr-nb and amr-wb from -bad to -ugly (and adapted it appropriately)- Adapted unit testsHopefully I did not miss anything :). If you find something wrong let me know and I'll fix it.Also, while preparing the patch I found an amrparse plugin in -bad (gst). At first glance it looks like this plugin implements the same stuff as the amrnbparse and amrwbparse elements, I do not know if there is a good reason to have these three elements or if it is just duplicated code.++We should remove the parsers from arm plugins. The idea is to have one big parser plugin in good with all the parsers. Also the parsers are usualy not affected by the codec license situation.Iago, could you remove the parsers from the patch against -ugly.++Yes, makes sense. Actually, I thought on doing that already when I found about this, but in the end decided to wait just in case I was missing something.I'll provide a new version of the patch for -ugly removing those parsers later today or tomorrow.++I think we should keep parts of the amrwb plugin in -bad for the time being, so that there still is an amrwb encoder available in GStreamer. So maybe just remove amrwbdec and amrwparse from the amrwb plugin in -bad, but keep amrwbenc until wideband encoding is added to the opencore codecs?++I just found this (from Debian Sid):$ apt-cache search opencorelibopencore-amrnb-dev - Adaptive Multi Rate speech codec - development fileslibopencore-amrnb0 - Adaptive Multi Rate speech codec - shared librarylibopencore-amrwb-dev - Adaptive Multi-Rate - Wideband speech codec - development fileslibopencore-amrwb0 - Adaptive Multi-Rate - Wideband speech codec - shared librarywhich provide the opencore amr codecs already, it is the same stuff I included in my patch as part of the amr plugins (I included the codec sources as part of the plugin), guess it does not make sense now... should I rewrite the patch to use these packages instead and keep it as a plugin with external dependencies?++> $ apt-cache search opencore > libopencore-amrnb-dev - Adaptive Multi Rate speech codec - development files> ...

I would be in favour of that, since it just seems The Right Thing To Do. However, it would probably be inconvenient for users of other distros where no such packages exist yet. I think, however, that we should nevertheless just forge ahead with this; livna etc. will likely package it soon enough as well then. In the mean time, Christian could create source rpms for people :DLet's see what others think...++Happy either way, as long as there's actually an upstream tracker/code repo to track necessary changes. Are we also sure that they don't break ABI all the time, and that the libraries are from upstream (not a packager's work)?The git repo mentioned in comment 0 doesn't exist anymore.++Those debian packages where briefly discussed during GUADEC and my opinion then as now is that we should only switch to using them if there seems to be a serious upstream available. Meaning that there is actually someone maintaining that code as a separate project, who  makes sure to pull updates from Android, and who makes releases the different distros can package. Without even a real website I am a little concerned that at this point these libraries are not really maintained and thus is would be better to keep our own code copy for now.++http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencore-amr/develop++Created attachment 138499  [details]  [review] Opencore AMR plugins, patch for -badUpdated version of the patch for -bad that keeps the original amr-wb encoder from ext/amrwb.++Created attachment 138500  [details]  [review] Opencore AMR plugins, patch for -uglyUpdated version of the patch for -ugly that removes redundant amrnbparse and amrwbparse elements.++Ok, while people reach consensus about these opencore amr packages I just uploaded an updated version of the patches that implements the changes suggested:  - remove amrnbparse  - remove amrwbparse  - keep amrwbenc from -badAccording to the link LRN posted above it looks like the project is still alive but has been moved to sourceforge, I'll send an email to the developers and see if they can clarify some of the questions people dropped here.++> I'll send an email to the developers and see if they can> clarify some of the questions people dropped here. FWIW, I sent them an email yesterday as well :)++So, after talking to the libopencore-amr developers, it looks like:- They intend to maintain the library in the future.- They do not intend to create packages for other distros (although theywould accept patches for that).    - We could ask distros to create the packages if the developers create regular releases.- They do not expect to break API/ABI.++So I guess the consensus is that with these plans in place there is no reason for us not to depend on this external library instead of keeping our own copy. So feel free to go ahead and update the plugins to use these libraries. Maybe add a readme to the plugin directory pointing people to the place to get the tarball releases of the library.++Created attachment 139004  [details] Opencore AMR plugins, patch for -bad++Created attachment 139005  [details] Opencore AMR plugins, patch for -ugly++Attached patches that use external opencore-amr libraries from http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencore-amr/ instead of copying the opencore amr codec source code.After applying the patch, this is the result:gst-plugins-bad/ext/amrwbenc  - Contains the amrwbenc plugin that provides element amrwbenc based on the reference implementation from 3gpp.gst-plugins-ugly/ext/amrwbdec  - Contains the amrwbdec plugin that provides element amrwbdec (based on opencore codec)gst-plugins-ugly/ext/amrnb  - amrwnb plugin that provides elements:    - amrnbdec, based on opencore codec.    - amrnbenc, based on opencore codec.This patch also removes the element amrnbparse and amrwbparse, amrparse from -bad should be used instead.Added README files as Christian suggested pointing to the the opencore-amr site for others to obtain the source code of the opencore amr codec.Edited the docs in -bad and -ugly according to these changes.++Is opencore-amr a ""problematic"" package, e.g. will it be packaged for Fedora?++It is, Nokia and others are collecting AMR patent royalities, so it will go into -ugly and not good.

I suppose your evolution is of version 2.31.1, and evolution-mapi version is 0.32.1 (it's pretty strange to mix evo 2.31.x with ema 0.32.x, maybe a typo?).

After more review of the code, I have decided to maintain the requirement that gparted be run by root.  It is a non-trivial exercise to change gparted to only prompt for root when it requires elevated access.Regards,Curtis Gedak++Re-opening this bug (yes again :-).  gksu is not supported across all major GNU/Linux distributions (e.g., Fedora) as pointed out in bug #529622 .As Björn pointed out in comment #3 , PolicyKit should provide a better solution.From a quick google search, it would appear that PolicyKit usage is a fairly recent addition to GNU/Linux distributions:Ubuntu - will introduce PolicyKit in Hardy Heron (v8.04)Fedora - introduced PolicyKit in Fedora 8SUSE   - introduced in 10.2Debian - will introduce PolicyKit in Lenny++As I do not have a firm grasp of how to solve this problem using PolicyKit, I have implemented an interim enhancement.A check has been added to the configure process to determine if the gksu program is available.  In this way GNU/Linux distributions that use gksu can benefit from being able to invoke gparted from the menu and prompt for the root password.  At the same time, distributions without gksu are not adversely affected.Any assistance with how to solve this bug using PolicyKit would be much appreciated.++Deassigning this bug because I am not actively working on it.++The Ubuntu package has a patch to make gparted use pkexec.  Maybe you could include that?++Phillip, is pkexec used by other distributions, such as Fedora, Debian, or SUSE?The ideal goal would be to not request root access until it is needed by GParted.  This is a non-trivial task to change GParted to work this way.  In fact just scanning all the drives requires root access, so this would only be useful for perhaps plug-in user-access USB drives.A desirable middle ground would be to use a mechanism available on all GNU/Linux distributions to acquire root privilege when GParted is invoked.  Currently the GParted desktop icon will configure to use ""gksu"" if it is available.++You said back in 2008 that Ubuntu, Fedora, SUSE, and Debian were moving to PolicyKit.  Not requesting root until it is needed would require a near complete rewrite of gparted to separate it into a gui frontend app and a separate backend to actually manipulate the disk.++My apologies Phillip.  I did not realize that pkexec was part of PolicyKit.If that is the case then this might indeed be a good solution to this problem.It might be a while before I get a chance to test this on the various distributions.  There is lots of active development on GParted and I need to review several in-progress bug developments.++*** Bug 693275 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++I think this bug is long overdue for closing as it was fixed by including gksu in the .desktop file.++Since the problem originally reported has been fixed by adding gksu (if available) to the .desktop file, I agree that this report should be closed.Marking this reported as RESOLVED."

553232,eog,image viewer,copy remote wallpapers locally,"This is the follow-up to bug 552109 , so it's not forgotten. In the above bug we fixed the Set-As-Wallpaper functionality to work again with GIO. As the desktop background infrastructure relies on the image being a local file we display an error asking the user to copy remote images to the local disk first.Luis Villa pointed out [1] that it would be nicer to have EOG do the copying itself. We didn't do this because this all happened the weekend before the final .0 release. Still, he's right IMO.So, we should first try to gather some information about the standard background directory Luis mentioned. Does it exist? Is it feasible to use by EOG?Obviously followed by some nifty implementation. :-)I'm not yet sure if we should make the Set-As-Wallpaper function an EogJob class (so we can do user feedback through that) or if it should be done on it's own.[1] http://mail.gnome.org/archives/release-team/2008-September/msg00210.html++But, do we really need a EogJob for this?

It works fine, but, there's almost no user feedback during the remote image reading.The image is saved with its original name under $XDG_USER_DATA_DIR. We may want to use something like $XDF_USER_DATA_DIR/eog, probably.++Haven't tested it yet, but I think this produces inconsistent behaviour, as the save as will preserve transformations. As this is only done for remote files, local files will be unchanged while remote ones keep the rotation/flipping. Hmm, maybe a special EogCopyJob, or ""save as"" local files too?We should probably ask the user first before copying as well if we do it for remote files only.++It's true that there's inconsistent behaviour regarding the transformations. I think that it may make sense to ""save as"" local files, if they have unsaved transformations, but I wouldn't like to be copying lots of files. Also, eog is not an application that saves modifications without prior user consent, so I would stick to that rule, for consistence (which will lead me to write a EogJobCopy job)As a side note, the feedback during saving is quite suboptimal. If there are no modifications in the image, during ""saving as"", eog actually copies the original file (because, in this case, the original and target formats are the same), so we are reading the image from the remote source again, without giving any feedback (this also happens during real ""save as"" under the same conditions, so I think we should fix this anyway).I don't think there's much urge in telling the user. Epiphany and others web browsers cache the images from the web in order to set them as wallpaper.++(In reply to comment #6 ) > > As a side note, the feedback during saving is quite suboptimal.

73997,gnome-session,gnome-session,Add option to save current session,"save current session is clearly an action not a prefs dialog.++Calum, Seth...what's your take on this?++Yeah, it would kind of make sense to have it next to 'Logout' on theactions menu, I guess.  Although right now I can't even see an itemfor ""Save Current Session"" on my Applications->Preferences menu, whereis it?  (My build is a few days old, admittedly).Right now I'm also seeing two adjacent menu items inApplications->Preferences->Advanced, one labelled ""Session Properties""and the other labelled ""Session Properties & Startup Programs""--that's even more confusing...++My take on this is ""Save current session should not exist"". If theyexist at all, sessions should be always, automatically be saved.++It's not quite as simple as just 'always automatically doing it',though, because my understanding of the multi-session requirements arethat in theory I can save my current session under any name I chooseat any time, and load it again later... Glynn can probably clarifythat, though, and explain why there currently isn't an easy way to doit from the GUI :o)++Or it could be that I just want one thing on startup and don't carehow I left it when I logged out. That's a lot of flexibility that islost there.++People _hate_ continuous save. It isn't what anyone wants.We've tried it in the past.What people want in my experience is to set up a fixed arrangementthat they always get on login, then save that arrangement, and alwaysget it back. And it sucks if you have to log out and check the ""savecurrent setup"" box in order to do this.++Well i don't like the term 'session', its too implementation orientedThe current logout screen uses setup, which seems vague.But I can't think of a short description...Save Current Desktop State Save Current Application State(I don't think I like either of these - perhaps i don't reallylike it being an 'action')If you look at CDE http://www242.pair.com/nilsp/session.gif (although they do use the term session), it may offer a solution to keep sethand hp happy?++I can't guess from looking at the CDE dialog what the radio buttons inthat dialog would do if I selected them. Maybe more context wouldhelp. ;-)In ""msm"" I was using ""save currently-open applications"" which is a bitlong for the menus - but the basic user-interesting idea I think is that you're saving which apps you have open.Maybe ""Remember current applications"" or ""Save open windows"" orsomething like that?++Another option is to make it into an actual app or control panel, instead of having it be an action. Just have to figure out what theapp looks like.++Guys ? Any decision on this.The user needs to have some way of saving his setup, so we can't leavethis hand indefinetly. I'm leaning towards putting 'Save currentsetup' in the actions menu until someone implements a decent GUI basedapp to do it..++What is a ""current setup"". Even after knowing what it is, every time Isee this in the logout dialogue I sit their wondering. What setup?What's setup? If I don't ""save my current setup"" will I lose all mypreferences? If I don't ""save my current setup"" will my newly addedpanel applets or their positions be lost? This is totally ambiguous.1) Have no explicit interface for ""saving current setup""2) Remove ""save current setup"" from the logout dialogue3) Always save ""current setup"" at logout OR never save current setupat logout (this might be worthy of a preference, or maybe not)++If we really need to accomodate people with fixed setups that theyalways want to login to (I haven't seen this used too often, but Isuppose based on all the noise some people are doing it), we shouldput it in the Sessions ""capplet"".++If this is to happen before 2.4.x freeze we're running out of time.++Is this bug still valid?++I agree with Seth that if we want to do it, this should be done ingnome-session-properties.++Sorry to spam this bug report, but I could not figure out where is gnome-session-properties hidden in this bugzilla, so I just wanted to drop here the fact that it seems the ""save session"" option disappeared from logout dialogs, so it would need to either reappear in the logout dialogs, or reappear in gnome-session-properties (I would prefer that, as it would not force the user to log out).++This has been fixed in HEAD. We have a ""Save current session"" button in the capplet."

Therefore there are two entries in /proc/mounts for '/', and they look like this:    rootfs / rootfs ro,relatime 0 0    none / aufs rw,relatime 0 0When querying the filesystem using gio in the chroot, find_mountpoint_for(…) will return the first one (that of the host), and consequently reports that the filesystem in the chroot is read-only, which is incorrect.Using /proc/self/mountinfo fixes the issue: only the mounts relevant to the chroot are exposed there.++Review of attachment 193313  [details]  [review] :Your patch should be generated by ""git format-patch"".::: gio/gunixmounts.c@@ +189,3 @@ +// for documentation on /proc/self/mountinfo,+// see http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt No C++ comments in .c@@ +190,3 @@+// for documentation on /proc/self/mountinfo,+// see http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt +#define MOUNTINFO ""/proc/self/mountinfo""Call this variable PROC_MOUNTINFO_PATH maybe for clarity?@@ +197,3 @@+  struct stat buf;+  return (stat (MOUNTINFO, &buf) == 0) ?

It is difficult to determine non-visually that one has written more text than will fit.  Orca should therefore inform the user when this has occurred and, ideally, detail the extent to which the text has ""bled"" into subsequent cells.(Suggested at Boston Orca users group)++We probably can get the extents for the text and compareit to the extents for the current table cell.

Asdescribed by the original comment that would be nice to workaround it.++*** Bug 325290 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++rephrasing subject++*** Bug 317083 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++the IRC transcript quotes rather daming comments from me, but I don't actually think a workaround for this would be a horrible thing.  I copy a little from my comments to bug 317083 :""the bug is about Evolution displaying the octet value 0x80 as the glyph  |00|  |80|rather than the euro sign (€), even though the charset is declared to be ISO8859-1.  in other words, the broken client sends out characters from theCP-1252 coded character set, but claims the characters are in ISO 8859-1.  theRFCs don't have anything to say about that...this bug doesn't really touch on RFC 2047 decoding at all.  it's just arequest to be a bit lenient and special case the octet value 0x80, so that itmaps to the Unicode U+20AC.  personally, I don't see a great harm in that.""I don't know if there are other characters in CP-1252 which could do with similar remapping.  I'm pretty sure the euro character is the most noticable one.BTW, the subject for this bug should be changed back so that it is less misleading.++At least bug 325290 is about a slightly different topic of what is the proper delimitation of the =??Q??= encoding. RFC 2047 states that it should always be separated by white space from other header words, but in practice a lot of clients, Outlook in particular, don't respect this when encoding the headers. It's a case of ""be strict when you encode, and lenient when you decode"".My interpretation of bug 317083 is that it's not about the charset either (at least primarily), but the same ""what's an encoded-word"" decision. Quote from the RFC:   IMPORTANT: 'encoded-word's are designed to be recognized as 'atom's   by an RFC 822 parser.  As a consequence, unencoded white space   characters (such as SPACE and HTAB) are FORBIDDEN within an   'encoded-word'.  For example, the character sequence      =?iso-8859-1?q?this is some text?=   would be parsed as four 'atom's, rather than as a single 'atom' (by   an RFC 822 parser) or 'encoded-word' (by a parser which understands   'encoded-words').  The correct way to encode the string ""this is some   text"" is to encode the SPACE characters as well, e.g.      =?iso-8859-1?q?this=20is=20some=20text?=   The characters which may appear in 'encoded-text' are further   restricted by the rules in section 5.I can't find a good quote about the ""whitespace must precede =? and trail ?="" part, but it's implicit by how whitespace should be treated when two encoded-words follow each other. Anyhow - in most of the cases quoted in the linked bugs, the encoded-words violate the quoted paragraphs above, but as they are commonly occuring cases in real-world email, Evolution should treat them ""as they were meant"".++I really think this should be a WONTFIX.Hmm... users would *not* really like that though.++WONTFIX would be the simple choice, yes, but what is most important, standards compliance, security, or interoperability? I would say that without the latter, the former two are meaningless.++oa, which bug are you talking about?anyway, interoperability is defined by standard compliance.  only when the standard is incompletely specified, leading to ambiguities, should you consider mimicing other implementations to enhance interoperability.++My apologies - my comment is relevant for Bug 325290 and perhaps Bug 318083 , but not this one, as those two are NOT duplicates of this.A comment relevant to this bug: it seems that for some encodings, Evolution does not display the properly decoded form in the listview although it does in the message display.

In this case, there certainly is no problem with the character sets.The one displaying the error is much older, first read with an older version of Evo. Should I clear some cache for this test? Which one and how?++yes, you'll prob need to clear your cache. what you need to do is delete .ev-summary file for the mailbox in question.++I deleted all cache directories and summary files under .evolution/mail/imap4, but the problem persists. Messages containing the first From header display incorrectly (in listview only), messages with the second header are OK.

109871,gnome-print,general,Wishlist:  UI Problem With Gnome Print Dialog,"I posted this initially in Evolution, but they said it belonged here. Thereis a significant problem in the UI for dialog box that comes up in Gnomewhen you attempt to print.  The UI assumes a level of skillset that isn'tthere for the hundreds of users that we support.Here is what I wrote--> (SNIP)I was under the impression that the 1.3/1.4 series was going to have someupgrades in the area of making it easier for our users to get their emailto print.  The interface in 1.3 would be very hard for them to use.If you select ""lpr"", an option menu should appear next to ""lpr"" thatdisplays all of the printers configured on the system/server.  The optionmenu needs to cascade if more printers are on the server than will fitbased on your font.  In our case we have about 80 printers that will appearin that widget.1.3 as it stands right now is actually worse, because it will require themto select ""Custom"" and then type in the command into the single line textwidget that appears. It seems like just like 1.2.x, the printer settings don't stick.  It'sobvious the software is designed for a workstation where one would configurea  default printer and then just lpr would work fine.

However the code is somewhat roughand the patches towards the end have just been thrown together.  Lookbut don't review.I would like you to give it a bit of a test.What do you think about new menu items:  Initialize Encryption / Clear Encryption  Open Encryption Volume / Close Encryption VolumeThey seem the right way to keep as analogus of format and mount/unmount for thefile systems, optionally within LUKS.Also without being able to enter LUKS passphrases yet GParted can'topen or close any encryption volumes.  This leads to:1) Move, delete can only be performed when LUKS is closed2) Resize can only be performed when LUKS is open,   plus requires libparted >= 3.2 and kernel >= 3.6 for online partition   resizing because GParted can't close LUKS yet because it can't   re-open it.But it do resizing of file systems and LUKS given the above requirementsare met.  (Not yet enforced in the code)!This patchset is way too big so I plan to separate out much of therefactoring.Thanks,Mike++Hi Mike,I've started to look at this patch set.  Over 6600 lines!  That's a lot of coding and refactoring.  :-)Before even testing the patch set, the open and close encryption volume menu items make sense to me.  The initialize and clear encryption menu items are not as clear to me, at least at first glance.  I assume these are to ""format the partition with encryption"", and to ""wipe out the partition"" respectively.  I'll figure it out as I test the patch set.Curtis++Hi Curtis,As this patchset is actions not requiring a passphrase (actually notchanging the busy state of the LUKS encryption mapping at all) the menuoptions don't do anything, other than change their name depending onwhether the LUKS mapping is already open or closed.  They are there soyou can see what I am planning.  Will probably remove them from thefinal patchset as they aren't part of the set of actions not requiring apassphrase.Mike++Hi Mike,From testing I re-discovered that there are a lot of things toconsider when working with encryption.Following are the details and results from testing patch set (d1) from comment #1 .Test Machine Description:    VMWare Virtual Machine with Ubuntu 15.10    Test device /dev/sdb used an MSDOS partition table.

When password handling available, should either prompt for    password, or be disabled.[2] Paste created preview that was 2 MiB smaller than original    partition.  The operation fails when applied.[3] Formats partition and maintains encryption.  This is as expected.[4] Check also tries to maximize both encrypted area within partition    and file system within ecnrypted partition.  This is as expected.[5] Labelled file system, but did not open up Label column in GParted    display beside File System column.  Instead there is an empty    Mount Point column displayed.  The empty Mount Point column    appears to be displayed if a luksOpen encrypted partition exists    on the disk.    The Label and Mount Point columns should display only if there is    data in these columns.[6] Grew the encrypted ext4 file system and partition.    When password handling available, should also be able to move and    shrink.In terms of the menu names, it would be nice to have something shorterthan:    Open Encryption Volume / Close Encryption VolumePerhaps:    Open Encrypted Volume / Close Encrypted VolumeOr:    Open Encryption / Close EncryptionHaving said that, the term ""Volume"" does help differentiate thisencrypted area as being different than a partition or a disk.  Maybethe long name is best.For the other two, specifically,    Initialize Encryption / Clear EncryptionI wonder if we might consider something different like:    Encrypt Volume / Destroy Encrypted VolumeIdeally we want users to be clear on the difference between formattingand encrypting.Curtis++Hi Curtis,Thanks for testing.Comments on testing findings where needed-----------------------------------------[1] Formatting over the top of closed LUKS.Yes when LUKS password handling is added and encrypted partitions can becreated and opened then this will be disallowed.  The user will thenhave to use ""Clear Encryption"" menu item to allow the partition to beformatted with an unencrypted file system.  Equivalent also applies topasting into existing partition with closed LUKS.[2] I assume you were pasting into a new partition (from open LUKS).[2.1] Pasted partition is 2 MiB smaller than the original.The LUKS format reserves 2 MiB at the start of the partition for theheader and key slots.  This makes the encryption mapping block device(and therefore the file system) 2 MiB smaller than the partition.  Copy/paste works as the file system level (actually the block device directlycontaining the file system, in this case the encryption mapping).Therefore this is expected.[2.2] Applying copy/paste of encrypted into a new partition failsBug; will fix.(Must have always been testing with pasting into existing partitions)![5] Labelled encrypted file system not shownBug; will fix.(I was always testing on a disk with existing plain partitions withmount points and labels so they were always shown in the main window).[6] Grow only of mounted encrypted ext4 file systemRemember that a mounted ext3/4 file system can only be grown, notshrunk, hence the restriction.  Yes when opening/closing LUKS isimplemented moving of open LUKS will be implemented.Menu item names---------------Using ""Encrypted"" only saves a single character so doen't seem worth it.Lets go with:    Open Encryption / Close EncryptionThe initialize / clear menu item is harder.  There is no way with LUKSto encrypt a partition keeping the existing data without taking a fullcopy of the data and restoring it.  Therefore the single ""initialize""word needs to convey that any existing content is lost.  I don't think""Encrypt Volume"" says that.  I prefer something like:    Format Encryption    Create Encryption    Initialize EncryptionI really like ""Destroy"".  It really says everything will be lost.(However it will use erase_filesystem_signatures() to implement so therewill be a sub-detail saying ""clear old file system signatures in/dev/PTN"").  So for now I'll use:    Initialize Encryption / Destroy EncryptionAnyway as mentioned above these menu items won't be in this patchset.They will appear later when entering of passphrases are supported.What next---------I am going to create a separate refactoring patchset and shrink this onedown before submitting any more code.Mike++Hi Mike,Great progress on this enhancement.  It is far from an easy task with the current structure of the program.Further comments to your comments follow. > [2] I assume you were pasting into a new partition (from open>     LUKS). Yes, that is exactly what I did.  I did not test pasting into an existing encrypted partition.  That would be a good test to try. > [2.1] Pasted partition is 2 MiB smaller than the original.  > The LUKS format reserves 2 MiB at the start of the partition> for the header and key slots.

I had anticipated that the copied partition would be the same size as the original because I *assumed* that the new copied partition would be the same (for example encrypted and containing an ext4 file system).We should be sure our users know or are warned what the copied partition will look like (e.g., encrypted or not).  Otherwise it might be a surprise to copy an encrypted partition to a new partition to discover that the encryption is missing from the new partition.  At least those are my thoughts at the moment.I look forward to your next patch set.  No rush on my part, especially with the holiday season approaching.Curtis++Hi Curtis,As you have seen copying encrypted file systems as currently implementedis somewhat non-obvious, but for good reasons.The choices for copying are either (or both):1) copy the partition containing closed LUKS,2) copy the encrypted data inside an open LUKS.I didn't wan't to implement the first option because that alsoduplicates the LUKS header containing the UUID, passphrase and masterencryption key.  From a security point of view having additional copiesof encrypted data with the same master key is an extra risk; but it alldepend on what what is going to happen with that copy.  The CryptsetupFAQ [1] talks about how to make a backup at the file system level andblock level, preferring file system level with separate encryption ifneeded.  It strongly recommends separate encryption if the copy isremovable or going offsite [2].  Also in the case of cloning the data,cloning the LUKS container is strongly discouraged [3].Therefore copying was implemented at the level of encrypted file systeminside the LUKS container.  However as this patchset doesn't implementcreation of encrypted partitions it can only create an unencrypted copyof the data.Given these security concerns I will disallow creating new partitionscontaining unencrypted copies of encrypted data until GParted can offerthe choice of creating encrypted copies, or not, in the copy dialogwhere the user gets to make the choice.The user can still copy an encrypted file system into another alreadyopen LUKS partition to keep their privacy, or copy into a plainpartition to remove encryption.Mike[1] The cryptsetup FAQ, Backup and data Recovery section https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/FrequentlyAskedQuestions [2] 6.7 Does a backup compromise security?""If you do network-backup or tape-backup, I strongly recommend to go thefilesystem backup path with independent encryption, as you typicallycannot reliably delete data in these scenarios, especially in a cloudsetting.""[3] 6.15 Can I clone a LUKS container?""You can, but it breaks security, because the cloned container has thesame header and hence the same master key.  You cannot change the masterkey on a LUKS container, even if you change the passphrase(s), themaster key stays the same. That means whoever has access to one of theclones can decrypt them all, completely bypassing the passphrases.The right way to do this is to first luksFormat the target container,then to clone the contents of the source container, with both containersmapped, i.e. decrypted.  You can clone the decrypted contents of a LUKScontainer in binary mode, although you may run into secondary issueswith GUIDs in filesystems, partition tables, RAID-components and thelike. These are just the normal problems binary cloning causes.Note that if you need to ship (e.g.) cloned LUKS containers with adefault passphrase, that is fine as long as each container wasindividually created (and hence has its own master key). In this case,changing the default passphrase will make it secure again.""++Hi Mike,Thanks for the background information.  I can see that you've looked deeply into the issue. > Given these security concerns I will disallow creating new> partitions containing unencrypted copies of encrypted data> until GParted can offer the choice of creating encrypted> copies, or not, in the copy dialog where the user gets to make> the choice. This sounds like a reasonable compromise at this time.Curtis++Created attachment 342116  [details]  [review] No passphrase LUKS read-write support (v1)Hi Curtis,Here is patchset v1 for this.  Issues identified in comment #4 and #5above are resolved.Also tested moving a closed LUKS partition, cancelling in the middle andhaving it roll back.  Confirmed both the partition and encrypted mappingcontent match before and after by comparing md5 checksums.Couple of questions:Q1) Is patch [P18/34] ""Display LUKS copy capability (#774818)"" a good    idea or not?Q2) In the File System Support dialog, LUKS shrink support is: Cross +    Tick.  Says that LUKS can't be shrunk when closed but only when    open.  This is not covered in the legend at the moment.  Consider    displaying differently as Space + Tick or Dash + Tick.  What ever is    decided the legend probably needs updating.Here's suggested fragments for the NEWS:Release Notes-------------  This release adds partial read-write support for LUKS encrypted file  systems.  GParted can't create, open or close LUKS encryption volumes;  however it can copy, resize and manipulate file systems inside open  LUKS volumes and move closed LUKS volumes.  (Resizing requires Linux  kernel >= 3.6 and libparted >= 3.2 for online partition resizing).  [More text mentioning other patches here.]  REMINDER:  You are strongly advised to backup you data before editing partitions  as a failure can lead to data loss.  This is especially true for  encrypted data where all of the data can become permanently  inaccessible after a failure.  Please refer to the Cryptsetup FAQ for  backup and recovery advice of encrypted data.

I still need to doa comprehensive code review.Following are answers to questions and test results.ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS==================== > Q1) Is patch [P18/34] ""Display LUKS copy capability (#774818)"" a>     good idea or not? A1) I think it is a good idea to show that LUKS can be copied (even it    if is only file system copying, not partition copying).  On the    web site we can put a reference number beside this ability and    then outline this difference in copying ability. > Q2) In the File System Support dialog, LUKS shrink support is: Cross>     + Tick.  Says that LUKS can't be shrunk when closed but only>     when open.  This is not covered in the legend at the moment.>     Consider displaying differently as Space + Tick or Dash + Tick.>     What ever is decided the legend probably needs updating. A2) Let me answer a question with another question.    Q2a) How close are you to implementing LUKS password support?    If soon, then we might skip over the issue of modifying the    legend, and jump ahead to implement LUKS password support before    the next GParted release.    If not soon, then showing a Cross + Tick isn't a bad temporary    solution.  It should raise questions in the users mind.  We can    add the Cross + Tick to the legend.  On the web site we can    outline the difference between copying a partition versus a file    system, and the need for encryption to be open to copy the file    system.TEST RESULTS============Overall, patch set (v1) works as I would expect.  From a testingperspective there is nothing to change other than updating the legend.Following are the details and results from testing patch set (v1) from comment #9 .Test Machine Description:    VMWare Virtual Machine with Ubuntu 16.10    Test device /dev/sdb used an MSDOS partition table.

Better just review v1 on itsown merits.(Draft 1 was thrown together where as v1 is polished and ready forcode review.  Draft 1 contained some refactoring where as that is not inv1 any more as it has already been committed under bug 775932 - Refactor mostly applying of operations). >> Q2) In the File System Support dialog, LUKS shrink support is: Cross>>     + Tick.

Not even started looking at LUKS password support yet.  I can see itbeing as big as this one so it's many months away.  Therefore I'll justadd a small patch which adds Cross + Tick to the legend.Mike++Also something else to think about: Does the GParted Manual needupdating for this and if so what?++Created attachment 343289  [details]  [review] No passphrase LUKS read-write support (v2)Hi Curtis,Here's patchset v2.  The only difference is the addition of the patch   Add ""Available online only"" to the Supported Actions legend (#774818)towards the end of the set.Mike++Hi Mike,Thanks for the updated patch set.  I will review v2 with an eye towards committing it to the git repository. > Does the GParted Manual need updating for this and if so what? With the GParted Manual I have tried to keep the document maintenance requirements low by not including all the different idiosyncrasies involved with each file system.That being said, I did include tips on how to shrink NTFS [1] due to the volume of questions we received in this area.[1] http://gparted.org/display-doc.php?name=help-manual#gparted-resize-partition We could consider adding another tip or note for resizing LUKS encrypted partitions.  Or we could make a post in the GParted forum detailing the steps.What do you think?Curtis++Hi Curtis,Scanning through the GParted Manual we could consider adding this to theend of the existing warning in the Introduction:  <!> Editing partitions has the potential to cause LOSS of DATA.      ...      Your are advised to BACKUP your DATA before using the /gparted/      application.[New]               This is especially true for encrypted data where all      of the data can become permanently inaccessible after a failure.      Please refer to the Cryptseutp FAQ for backup and recovery advice      of encrypted data.      The Cryptsetup FAQ https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/FrequentlyAskedQuestions As for the rest of the Manual, LUKS could be considered special enoughto have a few hints for various operations such as these:  (i) LUKS encrypted partitions can only be moved when the encryption      mapping is closed.  (i) LUKS encrypted partitions can only be resize when the encryption      mapping is open.As you say we want to keep the GParted Manual focused on using GPartedand not become a series of HOWTOs.Even less sure about adding a new page into the Manual, titled, and withsub-sections:  Managing LUKS  * List active LUKS Mappings  * Stopping LUKS Mappings  * Starting LUKS Mappings  For further information please refer to The Cryptsetup FAQAnd and links from the hints to the relevant stopping and starting LUKSsub-sections.Mike++Hi Mike,GPARTED MANUAL COMMENTS=======================Thanks for the GParted Manual suggestions.I am in favour of the first two manual enhancement suggestions.Specifically adding the CryptSetup stuff to the ""Editing partitionshas the potential to cause LOSS of DATA"" caution message.  Also addingthe hints for moving and resizing.I am not in favour of adding a ""Managing LUKS"" section because I thinkit sets a precedent for us to maintain more and more file systemspecific details.  These file system specific details belong more withthe file system and less with GParted, at least in my opinion.CODE REVIEW===========The code for patch set v2 in comment #13 looks good to me.I will change one minor typo in the following commit message:P 24/35 Implement resize/move operation of encrypted file systems (#774818)  CHANGE FROM:encrypted file system within to be resize in the right order for both                                        ^^  TO:encrypted file system within to be resized in the right order for both                                         ^REGRESSION TESTING==================In effort to check if prior functionality still works, I ran a seriesof tests in different VMs.  In my tests, things such as moving andresizing ext4 and ntfs worked as expected.However I did encounter one strange anomaly with growing and shrinkinga deactivated LVM2 PV wherein sometimes the VG was activated afterthe operation.Note that the anomaly exists with the latest patch set v2, and withthe official GParted 0.27.0 release, so the anomaly is not introducedwith this patch set.Distros Tested:- Fedora   24- openSUSE 42.1   A) Inconsistent behaviour where growing or shrinking a deactivated      LVM2 PV will also have the side effect of activating the VG.      TESTS      - Grow to 520 MiB a deactivated 512 MiB LMV2 PV works as expected,      but a following shrink LVM2 PV to original size has the side      effect of also activating the VG.      - Shrinking to a different size does not activate the VG.      - Shrinking a deactivated LVM2 PV to a smaller size works as      expected, and a following grow LVM2 PV to original size works as      expected (no side effect of activating the VG).      - Growing to 528 MiB a deactivated 512 MiB LVM2 PV has the side      effect of activating the VG.Unfortunately I have been unable to come up with 100% consistentbehaviour.  To me this implies that something other than just GPartedis activating the VG.I tried running similar tests in kubuntu 16.04 and saw differentbehaviour.  More specifically each grow or shrink of a deactivatedLVM2 PV seems to have the side effect of activating the VG.At the moment I don't think there is much we can do about this oddbehaviour.  Further the odd behaviour is not introduced by the patchset.Curtis++Created attachment 343367  [details]  [review] No passphrase LUKS read-write support (v3)Hi Curtis,Here's patchset v3.  The primary difference is the addition of thispatch towards the end of the set:  Add LUKS notes to the GParted Manual (#774818)Also moves this patch a couple of steps earlier.  No functionaldifference.  Use virtual get_filessytem_string() in remaining operation  descriptions (#774818)Mike++Regression: Resizing LVM PV (sometimes) starts the VGI've re-produced this behaviour too with GParted 0.27.0 on Fedora 24.My initial gut reaction is that there some new udev rule which isrestarting LVM VGs when the partition is resized (recreated bylibparted).Infact just running ""partprobe"" also causes an inactive VG to bestarted.++Hi Mike,Thanks for confirming the odd VG activation behaviour.  At first Ithought I was imagining things, so it's good to know I'm not losingmy sanity.  :-)The code for patch set v3 in comment #17 looks good to me.If you are in agreement, I will make the following

How often does this happen?    Every time after a reboot      Additional Information:   Started out with Evolution 1.0.2.   Read the FAQ about this subject (conscerning   Evolution 1.0.1 - I think) but the folder   ~/evolution/private already existed!   Upgraded to Evolution 1.0.8 - the bug still   remains!         Operating system is SuSE 8.0 Kernel: Linux 2.4.18-4GB #1 Wed May 29 15:47:24 UTC 2002 i586++I'm going to assume that this bug was related to libxml's xmlSaveFilenot doing proper error handling. I've written a replacement to thatfunction in evolution CVS so if that was the problem then it is fixednow. If it isn't the problem then I have no idea what else it couldbe.

482776,banshee,Importing,vbr mp3 encoding only offers low bitrates,"Please describe the problem:The setting dialog for lame doesn't offer the right options.  Lame vbr doesn't work like vorbis.  While the vbr-quality parameter does set a default bitrate target, the default is not reasonable.  Quality 0 selects 112 kbit and quality 9 chooses 8 kbit.  The ui currently shows quality 9 as best and quality 0 as worst, which is backwards.  These defaults are not reasonable as people want to encode at at least 128.  The dialog should present a list of preset bit rates instead of quality.  This is how quality settings are usually passed to lame on the command line.  Banshee should automatically select a vbr-quality that works well with the user's selected bitrate.  Banshee should choose a vbr-min-bitrate and vbr-max-bitrate surrounding the user's selected bitrate.  For example, if the user selects 190 from the drop down , banshee should pass vbr-quality=4 vbr-min-bitrate=170 vbr-max-bitrate=210 to lame.  A full table of suggested settings is available at http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Lame#VBR_.28variable_bitrate.29_settings Steps to reproduce:1. 2. 3. Actual results:Expected results:Does this happen every time?Other information:++This bug seems to read as an enhancement request, but I do believe it's pointing out a real problem. In a nutshell, what I'm seeing is that it's not possible to get high-quality VBR encoding using lame. I think this is a showstopper for lame VBR.However, my observations don't exactly match Andy's.First off, it's apparent to me that Banshee is intentionally presenting the scale as 0 (lowest) to 9 (highest), while lame uses 9 (lowest) to 0 (highest). You can see in mp3-lame.xml that the selected value is being subtracted from 9 to convert to lame's scale.I encoded a sampling of songs at a sampling of quality settings, looked at the average bitrates, and calculated a mean for each quality. Note that they don't come close to lining up with the target values from the table in Andy's link.Quailty        Average Bitrate (kb/s)Banshee  Lame  Measured  Target0        9     111       65 3        6     126       1156        3     138       1757        2     154       1908        1     157       2259        0     158       245On the other hand, in years of using lame on the command line, I've found that the average bitrates obtained do come quite close to the specified targets. So, my conclusion is that Banshee is not obtaining the same quality rates from lame that you get on the command line. I simply cannot get very low quality nor high quality VBR. In particular, note that how Banshee qualities 7-9 yield practically indistinguishable results.I have no idea if this is a problem with my configuration, a bug in Banshee, a bug in GStreamer, or if it's working as intended. I'm running a fresh install of Ubuntu 7.10 for amd64, with gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly 0.10.6, banshee 0.13.1, and lame 3.97. Can anyone help me diagnose things further?I disagree with Andy's suggestion that Banshee should be asking for a bitrate and calculating a quality and min and max bitrates from it. I think things should work just as simply as on the command line: you specify a quality and lame automatically does the encoding as it sees fit. We don't want people to think that they're going to get that bitrate exactly, or that they'll get a quality similar to CBR at the selected rate (it will actually be much better).++Sounds like the Importing process should more closely resemble the UI (and the command line equivalent).++I believe Andrew's comment is an misstatement of this problem.Simply, as I observe it, it is impossible to get high quality VBR MP3 encoding in Banshee.  I've just reconfirmed this using the latest in Ubuntu (banshee 1.2.1, gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse 0.10.7, and libmp3lame0 3.98), and things are appearing to work exactly as they did when I tried this a year ago.I cannot get an average bitrate of above 158 for VBR encoding, even at the highest quality setting. Using lame on the command line, I get up to 245. Unless I have some kind of configuration problem, that means Banshee is useless for ripping to VBR MP3 at good quality settings.This bug should really get some attention.++I've come across this bug (actually a setting) in several places, and have resolved it. The reason that you can't get above 158kbps vbr is not because gstreamer is failing, but rather because there is an absurd default value for vbr-max-bitrate as is documented at the below link http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-ugly-plugins/html/gst-plugins-ugly-plugins-lame.html#GstLame--vbr-max-bitrate To resolve your issue, simply change the default vbr-max-bitrate to a number higher than that you desire. It should really default to 320 (please change this in the code base to end the confusion), but it defualts to 160, which explains your low maximum bitrate. The below pipeline from my SoundJuicer profile demonstrates the solution.audio/x-raw-int,rate=44100,channels=2 ! lame preset=extreme vbr-max-bitrate=320 ! xingmux ! id3v2mux++Addendum to comment:using gst-plugins-lame-0.10.8and lame-3.98.2, setting the vbr-max-bitrate only works when passing presets. If I try to pass a vbr quality level, ie ! lame name=enc mode=0 vbr-quality=2 !I get a 128 kbps bitrate limited mp3 of the same bitrate regardless of the quality setting, so it appears that the vbr-quality parameter is not being properly passed to lame.Coincidentally 128 is the vbr-mean-bitrate default, but increasing the value of that parameter does not help. Can't help but wonder if this is somehow related.In all of this exploration, wondering why gstreamer can't simply pass the standard lame parameters instead of creating a whole new set of parameters.++Kurt,Thanks for your insights!  I think the problem is a combination of crummy defaults and pretty widespread misunderstanding about lame's encoding modes.Here's what I figure...bitrate: only applies to CBR (vbr=0)vbr-quality: only applies to VBR (vbr=2|4)vbr-mean-bitrate: only applies to ABR (vbr=3)vbr-min-bitrate: applies to VBR and ABR (vbr=2|3|4)vbr-max-bitrate: applies to VBR and ABR (vbr=2|3|4)With VBR, you specify a target audible quality and the average bitrate can vary depending on the particulars of the track. With ABR, you you specify a target average bitrate, and the audible quality can vary depending on the particulars of the track. In both cases, you can set upper and lower limits on the bitrate that will be employed for any frame (though, by default, the lower limit is ignored for silence).Note that what Banshee currently does for ABR, specifying a vbr-quality, doesn't make any sense and probably just results in the default vbr-mean-bitrate (128) being used. Unfortunately, I haven't seen any gstreamer docs that explain this well, but if you cross-reference with the man page for lame, it's pretty apparent.By default, lame doesn't set a min or max bitrate for VBR or ABR. In fact, the man page even says the following:The use of -B is NOT RECOMMENDED.  A 128 kbps CBR bitstream, because of the bit reservoir, can actually have frames which use as many  bits as a 320 kbps frame. VBR modes minimize the use of the bit reservoir, and thus need to allow 320 kbps frames to get the same flexibility as CBR streams.With lame recommending against using -B (which corresponds directly to vbr-max-bitrate), it seems totally wrong that GStreamer would impose it by default. I'm a total GStreamer newbie, but I'm definitely thinking I'll file a bug on this issue.Nonetheless, I've managed to work around this in Banshee by specifying values of 8 and 320 for vbr-min-bitrate and vbr-max-bitrate.  I took a look at the XML-based audio profile configuration (described at http://abock.org/2007/01/06/audio-profile-configuration-for-the-masses/ ), and found it was really easy to fix things up. Nice work Aaron!I'll attach my modified mp3-lame.xml file to this bug.++Created attachment 123524  [details] Improved LAME profile configurationThis is my modified mp3-lame.xml, which I think would form the basis for a much better default one.First and foremost, it specifies overrides for the very wrong GStreamer default values of vbr-min-bitrate and vbr-max-bitrate. This allows high and low quality settings to actually have an effect, and makes everything behave like it does, by default, on the command line.Second, I've fixed the way ABR works. Just like CBR, it should allow the user to choose a bitrate from a combo box. As I explained in comment 6 , specifying a VBR quality with just ABR isn't correct.Third, I've added the quality property, to ensure that high quality encoding is used even for CBR, as recommended by the lame man page. I can't see any reason not to do this, as there's no size penalty and machines just keep getting faster.Fourth, since I changed ABR to show the bitrate combo box, I thought it was funny to have ""VBR"" before ""Quality"" (for VBR) but not ""Bitrate"" (for ABR, which is actually also a type of VBR). Then I realized it's even funnier to have ""VBR"" before ""Mode"", when one option actually *isn't* VBR at all. So, I went for just ""Mode"", ""Quality"" and ""Bitrate"". Since there's no other kind of mode or quality setting on the dialog, I can't see any downside to the shorter names. This is simpler and better for people who aren't already familiar with the abbreviation. I've only changed the English version so far. I'm not sure how translation is usually done, but I think I could take a pretty decent stab at all of the languages except Dzongkha.  ;-)I've tested this and it all seems to work perfectly. It's still simple and it's more functional. Personally, the only room I see for improvement would be to use slightly higher quality default values (probably 160 Kbps and quality 6).++I confirm the original bug and the nature of the bug in comment #1 . The bug is still present in Banshee 1.4.1.1.I tried using the modified mp3-lame.xml (from comment #7 ) by changing it with the one present in /usr/share/banshee-1/audio-profiles/, but the new file was not used when running Banshee. How would I use this new .xml to give the settings a test?++Christoph,All I did was drop it into /usr/share/banshee-1/audio-profiles and Banshee started picking it up.  You're sure you put it in the right place and that it's not working?You can immediately see it's working if the first control on the Configuring LAME dialog (a combo box) is labeled ""Mode:"" instead of ""VBR Mode:"" in English. Also, if you start Banshee from a console window, you'll see output as it runs, including the pipeline it uses for encoding when you rip a CD. If I set to VBR with VBR quality 6 (which gets converted to 3 for lame), I see this:Ripping using encoder profile `MP3 (LAME Encoder)' with pipeline: audioconvert ! lame mode=4 quality=2 vbr=4 vbr-min-bitrate=8 vbr-max-bitrate=320 vbr-quality=3 ! xingmux ! id3v2mux++Created attachment 123722  [details]  [review] Update to improved LAME profile configuration (based on Banshee 1.4.1)I updated my improved mp3-lame.xml to be based on the version in Banshee 1.4.1.++Please provide your modifications to mp3-lame.xml as a patch to data/audio-profiles/mp3-lame.xml.inSee http://banshee-project.org/contribute/write-code/ for instructions.++Dave, Kurt, et al:  thanks for the great work.

It is using it's own list of desktopnames to figure out how many desktops should be there and then usesthis number to reset the entry in gconf. Is this the correctbehaviour? Should it not be using the entry out of gconf first andthen adjusting the list of w/s names. It is certainly confusing to theusers the way it is now.Damian++sawfish doesn't know anything about gconfthe only way for this to work correctly is if gnome-settings-daemon orwhatever it's called listens for new window managers starting up andsends them a _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS client messagethe wm-spec says nothing about window managers _reading_ the_NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS property, so I believe sawfish's currentbehaviour is spec-compliant++John, that sounds right. So do you have any ideas about how it shouldlisten for new WM's starting. Is there some sort message?

Sosending to g-s-d++*** Bug 94391 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++*** Bug 95224 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***++It seems the situation is worse than Damian theorized.  Looking at theGNOME 2.2 sources, gnome-settings-daemon knows nothing of wnck,neither the pager applet nor libwnck takes responsibility for storingthe number of workspaces(/desktop/gnome/applications/window_manager/number_of_workspaces has aschema but appears to never be used), and metacity solves the problemby keeping track of the number of workspaces in its own gconf variable/apps/metacity/general/num_workspaces.The CVS head seems to be the same (wncklet/workspace-switcher.c stilldoesn't store the number of workspaces).The GNOME wm spec seems very sparse (I'm looking at http://developer.gnome.org/doc/standards/wm/book1.html and wonderingif there's a better version somewhere) and doesn't say who hasresponsibility for remembering this stuff.  It's possible that the bugshould be kicked back to sawfish, which should remember the value in.sawfish/custom or something.  That would be consistent with metacity,though that doesn't necessarily make it the best answer.++I am convinced that the right answer is for GNOME to take care ofsaving the number of workspaces, so that the number is notwindow-manager-dependent.  However, in the spirit of the easyworkaround, I will attach a poorly-written local hack to sawfish tomake it save the number of workspaces in a private area much likemetacity does.  (I say ""poorly written"" primarily because I don'tthink I'm supposed to be loading stuff at the end of workspace.jl likeI am; there should probably be some initialization function which getscalled at some more well-defined point in the process.  Also,""internal-set-number-of-workspaces"" is a dorky name.)++Created attachment 18573  [details]  [review] Kludgy local sawfish hack to save number of workspaces++For the confused masses,the way to workaround this bug is to click onPreferences -> Control Centerthen double-click on Windowsselect Workspacesand add as many entries as you prefer.  For example, addingWorkspace 1Workspace 2Workspace 3Workspace 4Workspace 5Workspace 6will give you 6 workspaces, and sawfish will remember thereafter.++is this bug still here ?++no reply, bug closed.

Excluding this directoryallows him to save some disk space.  I just had a look at these files andI see that they are way out of date!There are three problems here:1 - ~ftp/pub/gimp/MIRRORS points to ~ftp/etc/mirrors, which is not    accessible via rsync (only ~ftp/pub can be accessed).  As a result, our    mirrors cannot mirror the list of mirrors. ;-)2 - There are some broken links in the v1.*/old/* directories.  This can be    fixed easily.3 - The ""binary"" directory has not been maintained for a long time.  Most    of the files are dated from 1998 or 1999 (GIMP version 1.0 or 1.1 for    Debian and Solaris), except for a few files in the RPMS directory,    dated from January 2001 (version 1.2.0).  Most of the distribution    contain newer versions of the GIMP anyway, so these files are probably    doing more harm than good: those who install the binaries from our    ftp server or from one of the mirrors would be installing some outdated    stuff.Proposed solutions:1 - I don't know.  Maybe we could replace ~ftp/pub/gimp/MIRRORS with a hard    link to ~ftp/etc/mirrors instead of a symbolic link.  Since I am the    one who updates that file most of the  time, I can remember to update    the hard link if necessary.  Would that be OK?2 - That can be solved easily by updating the symbolic links.  I will do    that now.3 - Delete the ""binary"" directory?  Nobody uses it anyway, and those who    would try to use these files would only get outdated versions, assuming    that they can install them at all.  We tell everybody that the only    ""official"" versions are the ones in source code, so distributing    binaries on the ftp site is confusing, at best.  Especially if there is    no one to maintain them.I would like some discussion on points 1 and 3.  Comments are welcome.++I took care of the broken links in the ""old"" directories, so point 2 isfixed.++I agree that the binaries directory should go away. I even started toremove the files but there are a few files I cannot delete. Yosh willremove them later.++Point 3 is fixed now and I don't see any problem with the solution yousuggested for point 1. Why don't you just go ahead, make it so andclose this bug?++OK, done.  I have replaced the MIRRORS link.  I have also updated theREADME file while I was at it.

At first, I thought it wasthe Javascript print() function which was triggering it, but that works OKon a test page I created, so I think it's something to do with framingand/or popups (the Squirrelmail printable version is basically a popupchromeless window, with two frames - one with the ""print"" button in, whichcalls JS: parent.frames[1].print(), and one with the message in)The crash occurs as the printing dialogue box is created - you can see the(empty) print dialogue window appear semi-drawn (grey but with white boxeswhere text fields should be), and then it segfaults.++Created attachment 22851  [details] gdb backtrace at point that Galeon crashes++From GPrintingPromptService::ShowPrintDialog: 54         GtkWidget *gtkParent = MozillaFindGtkParent(parent); 55         GaleonEmbed *embed = GALEON_EMBED (MozillaFindEmbed (parent)); 56  57         dialog = print_dialog_new_with_parent (gtkParent, embed,&info);The trace and the warnings seem to indicate thatMozillaFindGtkParent() and MozillaFindEmbed() return NULL in thissituation; they probably don't work with frames.++Simple test case at http://patches.theflowerdays.com/js_print/++Thanks for the nice bug report, it really does help when someone tellsus exactly how to reproduce the crash :)Thanks also to chpe for the first patch version:2004-01-05  Crispin Flowerday  < gnome@flowerday.cx >	* mozilla/MozillaPrivate.cpp (MozillaFindEmbed): Ensure that	if the nsIDOMWindow provided is a frame inside an embed, we	get the top-level window and then get the embed from that.

110510,libwnck,pager,Mouse-up selects workspace even after drag,"Try clicking and holding on a workspace grid on the workspace-switcher, andthen dragging the mouse to a new workspace grid before you release themouse button.  The mouse-up event causes you to switch to the newworkspace, but it shouldn't.  The drag should have canceled the workspaceswitch.This is particularly an issue if you try to drag a window from oneworkspace to another, but miss the window.  You get switched to theworkspace you were trying to drag the window to, and the window hasn'tmoved from the first workspace.++Moving to right component. Sorry for the spam.++Created attachment 59634  [details]  [review] Proposed patchThis is a proposed patch. It could do with a review since I'm reusing some variables that are used for drag and drop to detect this case.It also changes the functions so that we immediately return if the button is not the left button."
244991,evolution,Mailer,cannot send mail in GB-2312,"I could not tell if this was a duplicate of bug 224026 but, after readingsaid bug, it seemed different.  I figured it was easier if I just filedanother bug report, since marking a bug duplicate is a simple operation.Description of Problem:Outgoing email from evolution appears to always be encoded as UTF-8Steps to reproduce the problem:1. Run evolution, in simplified chinese locale in RH9   (I'm using miniChinput-0.0.3-37 for my XIM, but I believe that shouldn'tmatter)2. using the menu, open a composer window for a new email message3. address the mail to some other email account (say your foobar@yahoo.com account)4. type a subject in (I used english, just in case that affectedevolution's behavior)5. Select ""GB2312"" as the character encoding6. type an email body in Chinese7. SendActual Results:Open the email in yahoo mail, and select ""GB2312"" as the character encoding-- the characters are rendered incorrectly.  However, if you select the""UTF-8"" encoding, the characters are rendered properly.Expected Results:Vice versa -- in other words, the characters should render correctly withGB2312 selected in the browser and incorrectly with UTF-8 selected.How often does this happen? Every Time.++Currently, to work around this bug, I am not using evolution to sendmail but rather yahoo mail.++this means that your typed text does not fit inside GB2312.++Jeff, let me make my step #6 more precise, as I believe the clarifiedversion will provide a counterexample to your theory.6. type the following email body:ÄãºÃÂð(I hope that bugzilla stores that as GB2312.  I will attach the datain a file if it does not)These characters happen to all be in the GB2312 character set.  Theirhex values are as follows: 0xc4e3, 0xbac3, 0xc2f0 > echo -n 'ÄãºÃÂð' | od -t x1 0000000 c4 e3 ba c3 c2 f0I can look up their GB2312 table numbers if you think that would beuseful.This is actually the message body that I typed, so the rest of the bugreport remains the same under this clarification.++Luckily bugzilla stored the data verbatim.  If you switch your browserto GB2312 and have the correct fonts installed, you should see thecharacters.++aha, seems Linux libiconv does not support the charset alias GB-2312,it wants GB2312 instead and so it is failing to convert UTF-8 toGB2312, thus falling back to UTF-8++n/m, even after I fixed it to use the code that uses the appropriatecharset alias, I still get:(evolution-1.4:16110): camel-WARNING **: Cannot convert from 'gb2312'to 'UTF-8': Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide charactersorry, but the text you gave me will not fit into GB2312 according tothe system libiconv.I will commit my other fix tho...++wait, n/m, it works afterall. silly me.++Created attachment 42544  [details]  [review] 44991.patch++patch applied to CVS"
